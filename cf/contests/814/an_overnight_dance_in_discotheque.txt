Due to circles being either contained or disjoint, we can express the graph as a forest.
Then, we can separately solve each tree.

If we note that the answer is computed as the sum of all even nodes minus the sum of all odd nodes,
then this leads us to a dp solution, where dp[i][a][b] represents if we are at the ith node, the parity of components 1 and 2 (before & after midnight).
We will build it from the bottom-up. In my solution I compact a and b to a single variable x, ranging from 1-4.
