How do you express the sum of two numbers by only knowing their AND and OR values?

It is express as (2(a&b) + a^b);
which can be simplified to (a&b + a|b).

If you want to calculate (a^b), it is:
(~(a&b) & (a|b)), or alternatively, (a|b - a&b).

Ok, but if you know the sum of any two numbers, how does that help?
A system of equations can help determine the actual values of numbers.
 - Specifically, given a, b, c, we can calculate a+b, b+c, and c+a in 6 queries. Treating a+b as ab, b+c as bc, and c+a as ca, the value of a is (ab+bc+ca)/2-bc, or more simply, (ab+ca-bc)/2.

Using this fact, it becomes easy to calculate a, b, and c. From here, just query the sum of c and d in two queries; because you know the value of c, then calculating the value of d becomes easy.
- Because you only have to know the sum of each pair, and the sum requires two queries, it takes 2n queries, which fits under the constraints.

Knowing all the numbers, you can just sort them and take the kth number.
