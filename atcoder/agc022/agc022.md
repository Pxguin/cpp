## C. Remainder Game

This problem hurts. It's so easy to get 90% of the solution but the final touch was so hard to think of. 

First try to solve for one single number. It is easy to see that all moduli that we use will decrease. So, for all $N$ numbers, we can simply try all $50$ possible moduli in decreasing order, meaning we use each modulus at most once. 

The second observation is the cost function. It costs $2^k$, which is always greater than the sum of all $2^i$ for $1\le{i}\le{k-1}$. This means it is always more optimal to use all moduli $1...k$ than to use $k$ itself. So (the final touch), we can iterate over all $k$ in descending order and try seeing if we can avoid using each one. This implies building a graph and checking if each $b[i]$ is reachable from its $a[i]$ with the current set of moduli. If this is possible for all $b[i]$ then we remove $k$ from the set of moduli because we don't need it, and otherwise we keep it in the set. It takes $O(N^4)$ in my code.
