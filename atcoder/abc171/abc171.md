Rephrase this problem to finding the number of strings with length $|S|+K$ that contain $S$ as a subsequence. For simplicity denote $|S|$ as $N$.

Assume you have selected locations for all characters in $S$ in the final string, then let's fix $S_N$ and calculate. Take $S_1$ for example, if there are copies of $S_1$ between itself and $S_2$ then you can just shift $S_1$ to it's copy (i.e. you will double count strings). So to avoid this, assume $S_1$ is the last copy of itself (so avoid having another $S_1$ between itself and $S_2$). With this logic you avoid double counting all strings. So there are $26^B * {{i-1}\choose{n-1}} * 25^O$ where $B$ is the amount of characters before $S_1$ and $O$ is for all other characters.
	
But, you aren't fixing $S_1$ so you don't consistently know the value of $B$. So, we can instead fix $S_1$ but still run the same algorithm. This works for the same logic as in the above paragraph. $O(|S|+K)$ with precalculation of exponents, but mine runs in $O((|S|+K)log(|S|+K))$.

This was really difficult for me. Also I don't get why this works; I saw this in other solutions: <i>ans += C(n+k,i)*exp(25,n+k-i); </i> Also what does strivore mean?
