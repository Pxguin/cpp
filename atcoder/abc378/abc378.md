## F. Add One Edge 2
We basically have a path where all nodes have degree $3$ except the two endpoints with degree $2$. When adding an edge between those endpoints we form a cycle of all degree $3$ nodes. Calculating the amount of paths satisfying this constraint can be done with subtree dp; let $dp[i]$ be the amount of paths starting at node $i$ and going into its subtree, that contain only nodes with degree $3$ and terminate at a node with degree $2$. Paths can either wraparound the root of a subtree (only if the root has degree $3$) or stop at the root (only if the root has degree $2$), so handle these cases separately. The runtime should be $O(N)$. I would also check out the connected component solution in the editorial
