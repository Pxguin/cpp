## E. Set Add Query
We can speed the basic $O(NQ)$ solution up by noting that we add the size of the set to some element, as long as the element stays in the set. So we store a prefix sum of the size of the set, and only when an element is removed do we update its sum (w/ prefix sums) based on how long it was in the set for. Formally, if an element entered at query $A$ and exits at query $B$, then we add $ps[B-1]-ps[A-1]$ to the sum for this element. Because the set doesn't explicitly have to be stored, this algorithm runs in $O(N+Q)$.

## F. Non-overlapping Squares
Equivalent to APIO 2009 - Digging for Oil, except this has a grid size of $N*N$ and that has a grid size of $N*M$. It's such a minor difference that I'll just leave the [submission link](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc347/submissions/60023598).
