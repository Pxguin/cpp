E - Set Add Query

We can speed the basic O(NQ) solution up by noting that we add the size of the set to some element as long as the element stays in the set.
So we store a prefix sum of the size of the set, and only when an element is removed do we update its sum (w/ prefix sums) based on how long it was in the set for.
 - Formally, if an element entered at query A and exits at query B then we add ps[B-1]-ps[A-1] to the sum for this element.
