## E. Manhattan Multifocal Ellipse
The maximum coordinates (and $D$) are bounded by $10^6$ by their absolute value, so the maximum coordinates we have to consider are in the range $[-2\cdot{10^6},2\cdot{10^6}]$. Let this maximum coordinate be $C$.

Decompose the Manhattan distance into two separate sums, x and y coordinate sums. We can fix the x-coordinate of the point, which is in the range $[-C,C]$. This x-coordinate sum can be computed for all candidate x-coordinates in $O(1)$ with a sweep line.

Given that the x sum is $S$, it remains to calculate the number of distinct y-coordinates in the range $[-C,C]$ whose y-sum is at most $D-S$. After calculating all y sums, we can store prefix sums on the y sums and easily retrieve this value in $O(1)$ as well. So in total, the algorithm runs in $O(N+C)$.

## F. Maximum Composition
This idea is kind of similar to [USACO Gold - Fertilizing Pastures](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1306).

Let there be two functions $ax+b$ and $cx+d$. After simplification, $a(cx+d)+b\ge{c(ax+b)+d}$ if ${a-1\over{b}}\ge{c-1\over{d}}$. In other words, it's always better to compose a function $i$ after a function $j$ if ${a_i-1\over{b_i}}\ge{a_j-1\over{b_j}}$. So sort the functions by this order, and the problem can now be solved with knapsack where $dp[i][j]$ stores the maximum result given that we have considered up to function $i$, and have composed $j$ functions. At the end, return $dp[N][K]$.

The time complexity is $O(NlogN+NK)$.
