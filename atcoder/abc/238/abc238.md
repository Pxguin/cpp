## G. Cubic?
The answer to the query is yes, if in the sum of the multisets containing the prime factorizations of $A_L,A_{L+1},\dots{,A_R}$, each prime appears $3K$ times for any integer $K$. So we can define a prefix sum array of arrays (denote it $P$), of which the array at index $i$ contains how many times each prime has appeared from $A_1$ to $A_i$. Then for a query, subtract the numbers in $P_{L-1}$ from $P_R$ and check if all resulting numbers are multiples of $3$ (if so, then it works). To improve it, redefine the array at index $i$ to contain how many times each prime has appeared from $A_1$ to $A_i$, mod $3$. Then it remains to check if $P_R=P_{L-1}$. It can be done in $O(1)$ by hashing each $P_i$, for example, by taking the dot product with a random array of integers. 

The time complexity is as follows: denote $M$ to be the maximum $A_i$, then it is $O((N+M)logM + Q)$. Also, as is becoming a trend with AtCoder problems, if you want a more interesting/flexible hash function then check out the first editorial. It's slightly confusing but if you treat the statements as hints and try to make some progress yourself then it should be fine.
