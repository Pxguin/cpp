## F. MST Query
Use Kruskal's, and let $dsu[i]$ be the state of the graph after processing all edges with weight $\le{i}$.

Query: add edge $(a,b)$ with weight $c$. If $a$ and $b$ aren't connected in $dsu[c]$, then $c$ gets added to the MST. We now have to find which edge to remove from the MST; the weight of this edge will be the first $j$ such that $a$ and $b$ are connected in $dsu[j]$. So it runs in $O((C(N+Q))\alpha(N))$.
