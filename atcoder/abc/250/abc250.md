## E. Prefix Equality
We only want to check if the sets are equal so duplicates won't be counted. So XOR hashing can be used: give each number a unique hash value, so the hash value of a set of numbers is the xor of the hashes of all numbers in the set. If we run into a dupliate value then ignore it. Checking if these xor hashes are equal corresponds to checking if the sets are equal. Time complexity: $O(NlogN)$ because we use a set.
