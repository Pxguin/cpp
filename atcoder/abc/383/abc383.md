# ABC 383

## E. Sum of Max Matching
Iterate over edges in increasing order of weight, and store components DSU fashion. The motivation is that when two components get connected by an edge of weight $w$, then we greedily want to pair all currently unpaired nodes in those two components through this edge.

Basically, store the amount of unpaired $A$ and $B$ nodes for each component. The current edge will merge two components; pair up as many unpaired $A$ nodes in the first component with unpaired $B$ nodes in the second and vice versa. The minimum maximum edge weight on a path between those nodes is the edge we just added, which has weight $w$.

$O(MlogM+M\alpha(N))$ time complexity.
