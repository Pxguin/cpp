For the area of the triangle to equal one, we get by cross products that $XB-YA=\pm{2}$. We can discard the $-2$ case, as we can just negate both $A$ and $B$ in that case to get a sum of $2$. So solving $XB-YA=2$, for known $(X,Y)$, is a linear diophantine equation that can be solved with the extended euclidean algorithm. If a solution exists, it guarantees them to be within $\max(X,Y)$ which fits within the bounds. The algorithms works in $O(log\min(X,Y))$, which also defines the time complexity.
