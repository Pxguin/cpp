An $O(N^2)$ approach is to use push dp by brute forcing all possible $N\over{a_i}$ transitions for each $i$. Another $O(N^2)$ approach is to use pull dp by using prefix sums. Iterate over all $k\in[1,N]$ and add all values of $dp_j$ that satisfy $a_j=k$ and $j\equiv{i}\pmod{k}$. In other words, such that $j$ can transition to $i$.

This can all be evened out to $O(N\sqrt{N})$ by using push dp if $a_i\ge{\sqrt{N}}$, and so we only have to pull from prefix sums for all $k\in[1,\sqrt{N})$.
