Define a constant $K=\sqrt{M}$. Let the amount of time segments for person $i$ be $S_i$.

We can precalculate all queries involving a person $i$ satisfying $S_i\ge{K}$. There are at most ${M\over{K}}=\sqrt{M}$ people satisfying this condition, so we can just iterate through each of these people and precalculate all queries involving them using sweep line and prefix sums, in $O(N+M)$ time.

For queries $(a,b)$ satisfying $\max(a,b)<K$, we can naively compute their intersection with two pointers in $O(S_a+S_b)$ time. The total time complexity is $O((N+M+Q)\sqrt{M})$.

Alternatively, you can calculate the intersection for any two sets in $O(\min(S_a,S_b)log\max(S_a,S_b))$ with binary search and prefix sums (as a speedup of two pointers), so you can just discard the precalculation and memoize queries instead for $O(Q\sqrt{M}logM)$. The code is in the "atcoder_office_alternate.cpp" file.

A third solution is the combination of the first two: precalculate queries by using the sped up set intersection method described in the second solution. Answering queries satisfying $\max(a,b)<K$ can be done with the same function. This is much slower, however, running in $O((N+M+Q)\sqrt{M}logM)$.
