## F. Select Edges
Root the tree at $1$ and consider all nodes in the subtree of $i$. We can independently solve the problem on $i$ and then relay the result to its ancestor $a_i$, in typical subtree dp format. If we don't select the edge $(i,a_i)$, then we can select at most $d_i$ edges incident to $i$. If we choose to select the edge, then we can select at most $d_i-1$ edges.

Therefore, we calculate two separate dp values. $dp1[i]$ calculates the maximum answer for the subtree of $i$ given we have selected at most $d_i-1$ edges incident to $i$, and $dp2[i]$ calculates the answer given we have selected at most $d_i$ edges.

To solve for subtree $i$, we look at all of its children $c$. I'll describe how to calculate $dp2[i]$ because $dp1[i]$ is calculated in the same way. We basically select a subset $S$ composed of $d_i$ children, and the resulting dp candidate for $dp2[i]=\sum_{c\in{S}}(dp1[c]+w_{(i,c)})+\sum_{c\not\in{S}}dp2[c]$. To achieve the maximum value of this, we can first assume that we take all $dp2[c]$, then select the maximum $d_i$ values of $dp1[c]+w_{(i,c)}-dp2[c]$ and add this on. This runs in $O(NlogN)$.
