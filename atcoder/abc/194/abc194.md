# ABC 194

## E. Mex Min
Maintain a sliding window. Store a set for all numbers currently in the window of $M$, and also a counter for each number storing the amount of times it appears in the window. The mex of the window is the first number in the set.

When sliding the window to the right, we first add an element to the window. Update the counter array, and if this is the first occurence of $a_i$ ($cnt[a_i]=1$), then delete $a_i$ from the set. Now we remove the left of the old window, at position $i-M$. So update the counter, and if there are no remaining remaining occurences of $a_{i-M}$ ($cnt[a_{i-M}]=0$), then add $a_{i-M}$ back to the set.

Time complexity is $O(NlogN)$.
