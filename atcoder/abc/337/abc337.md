## G. Tree Inversion
Root the tree at $1$. Let $a_i$ be the number of inversions in the subtree of $i$; i.e. nodes $j$ such that $i>j$. Let $b_i$ be the number of inversions outside of the subtree of $i$; i.e. $i-a_i-1$. Let $c_i$ be the amount of nodes $j$ such that $par_i>j$ and $j$ is in the subtree of $i$.

The answer for a node $i$ can be calculated as follows: for all nodes $j$ in the subtree of $i$ (not including $i$), we add $a_j$ to the answer. For all nodes $j$ not on the path from $i$ to the root, we also add their $a_j$ values. For nodes $j$ on the path from $i$ to the root, we add $a_j+b_j-c_j$ to the answer.

The first two are pretty intuitive â€” we assume that $j=w$ and $i=u$, and so the only possible values for $v$ must be in the subtree for $j$. Therefore, add $a_j$. For the third, we add $a_j+b_j$ because $v$ doesn't have to be in the subtree of $j$. But, we subtract $c_j$ because the inversion pairs $(w=j,v)$ that $c_j$ comprises are impossible to form a simple path with for any $u$ in the subtree of $j$.

Calculating $a_i$ can be done with Euler tour for an $O(NlogN)$ time complexity. However, I chose the shorter method of small to large merging so my code takes $O(Nlog^2N)$.
