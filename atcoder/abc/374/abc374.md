# ABC 374

The time of each shipment either aligns with some $T_i$, or the previous shipment plus $X$.

Let $dp[i][j]$ be the minimum cost given the time is $T_i$ and we can make a shipment at this time, given we have $j$ orders to ship. We can then fix the amount of consecutive shipments we make, which is in the range $[0,N]$. Simulation suffices to compute the cost incurred by these shipments, and also the amount of orders left after these shipments. If the next shipment we can make after all those consecutive ones is $t$, then we transition to $dp[k][j]$; $k$ is the minimum value satisfying $T_k\ge{t}$ and $k>i$.

$NK$ states and $N$ transitions, so the time complexity is $O(N^2K)$.
