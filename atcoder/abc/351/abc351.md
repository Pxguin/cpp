## E. Jump Distance Sum
If we rotate the grid $45Â°$ (such that the $y=x$ line becomes the y axis) and scale by $\sqrt{2}$, then a point
$(x,y)$ becomes $(x-y,x+y)$. The movement of the rabbit becomes a shift in each of the four cardinal directions by $2$ units. Proof: $(x+yi)*cis45*sqrt(2) = (x-y,(x+y)i)$

The original distance between two points was the max of the x distance and the y distance; now, it is half of the manhattan distance. Also, it is clear that any two points are reachable from each other only if both the x distance and y distance are even. 

Under these new coordinates, either both coordinates are even or both are odd. So we can split the points up into two groups (by parity of coordinates) and separately calculate the sum of all manhattan distances for both groups.

Time complexity, due to sorting coordinates, is $O(NlogN)$.

## F. Double Sum
$\begin{align}\begin{gathered}\nonumber
\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=i+1}^N\max(A_j-A_i,0) \\
=\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=i+1}^N\begin{cases}
A_j-A_i & A_j\ge{A_i} \\
0 : A_j<A_i
\end{cases}
\end{gathered}\end{align}$

So for each index $j$ we only need to find the sum of $A_j-A_i$ across all indices $i$ satisfying $i<j$ and $A_j\ge{A_i}$. Denote the set of such $i$ as $S_j$. We can rewrite this as $\sum_{i\in{S_j}}(A_j-A_i)=|S_j|A_j-\sum_{i\in{S_j}}A_i$. These two sums can be independently computed with two Fenwick trees, and thus we get a solution running in $O(NlogN)$.
