## D. Div Game
We basically decompose $N$ into its prime factorization (if there wasn't the constraint that all $z$ must be distinct, then the answer is just the amount of primes in the factorization of $N$. For each prime $i$, if there were $p_i$ copies of $i$ in the factorization, then we would pick $z=i$ a total of $p_i$ times). But all $z$ must be distinct. So we can optimally pick $p_i$ once, then $p_i^2$ the next time, then $p_i^3$ after that, etc, until we can't do it anymore. The prime factorization can be retrieved in $O(\sqrt{N})$.
