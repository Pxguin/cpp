## F. Double Sum 2
For each $k$, find the sum of pairs $A_i+A_j$ such that $A_i+A_j$ divides $2^k$. Let this be $S_k$. Then the answer is expressed as $\sum_{k=0}^{25}{{S_k-S_{k+1}}\over{2^k}}$. To find $S_k$, we know that a pair $(i,j)$ satisfying $A_i+A_j\equiv{0}\pmod{2^k}$ also satisfies $A_i\equiv{-A_j}\pmod{2^k}$. So we can store the modular residues in a map and quickly lookup the sum (and amount) of values with the complementary residue.

Solution runs in $O(NlogA)$.
