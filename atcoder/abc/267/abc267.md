# ABC 267

## F. Exactly K Steps
For each node, find the farthest node away from it. It must be either endpoint of the diameter of the tree (proof by contradiction).

The answer for the query is the $K_ith$ node on the simple path between $U_i$ and the farthest node from $U_i$, which is either done with a dfs or by binary lifting and casework. Time complexity: $O((N+Q)logN)$.
