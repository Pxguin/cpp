D - Small Multiple

Consider a graph of all integers, where the nodes are the integers and there is an edge between a and b if their digit sum is 1 apart.
Then we want to find the shortest path from 1 to a multiple of K. 
Digit sums being one apart is the same as multiplying by some power of 10, then adding 1.
So we can instead treat the graph as having edges with weight 0 and 1.
Weight 0 connects two nodes a and b such that b = 10a, and weight 1 connects two nodes a and b such that b = a+1.

There are infinite nodes, but if we reduce each node to their remainder mod K then we only have K nodes now.
Then we want to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 (K%K=0).
