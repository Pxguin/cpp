## E. Handshake
Takahashi wants to constantly select a valid handshake with the maximum happiness yield. It can be sped up by binary searching on the minimum value of all the handshakes, $X$. The goal is to find the maximum $X$, as this will maximize the answer. Given this number $X$, we can use prefix sums to quickly calculate how many handshakes are performed, and also, the total happiness from these handshakes. If the number of handshakes is $\ge{M}$, then $X$ is valid. Otherwise it isn't valid.

Obviously, if the maximum $X$ still yields $>M$ handshakes, then we have to subtract some amount from our sum to get down to $M$ handshakes. But we can say that the extra handshakes must all have happiness value $X$, because otherwise, the optimal $X$ would instead be $X+1$. After all this the runtime is $O(NlogN)$.
