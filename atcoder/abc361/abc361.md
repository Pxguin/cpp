## F. x = a^b
The maximum $b$ is $log_2{N}$, which is at most $60$. Iterate over all $b$ and check to see how many $a$ satisfy $a^b\le{N}$, which is simply $\lfloor{\sqrt[b]{N}}\rfloor$. Store this in a count $cnt[b]$. We basically have all candidate values for $a$ and $b$, and now have to subtract the amount of pairs that produce duplicate values.

$a^b = (a^c)^d$ if $cd=b$. So the general idea is to iterate over all $c$ (only prime $c$ matter) and $d$ and subtract the amount of unique candidate pairs $(a',b')$ with $a'=a^c$ and $b'=d$ because these candidate values produce the same number as $a^b$; $a'^{b'}=(a^c)^d=a^b$. This amount equals to $cnt[b]$. It may be the case that the same candidate pair is subtracted more than once across multiple $c$, for which the inclusion-exclusion principle will take care of it. In total, the runtime is $O(log^3N)$.
