## D. Tak and Hotels
Binary lift. (assume $a_i<b_i$; then it's optimal to travel as far right as possible per day: $lift[k][i]$ is the hotel reached after $2^k$ days when starting from $i$.)

Answer each query by binary searching on the amount of days and binary lifting to find the hotel reached after that many days in $O(log^2N)$ (although note that it can be combined into $O(logN)$ as seen in the code).

$O((N+Q)logN)$
