## C. Not Argmax
(a dp problem finally came up.)

$dp[i][j]$ is the amount of permutations of $(1,\dots,j-i+1)$, that when assigned to the range $[i,j]$, satisfy all constraints $k$ where $[L_k,R_k]\in[i,j]$.

Compute $dp[i][j]$ as follows:
 - Fix the position of the maximum $m$.
 - If some constraint $k$ satisfies $[L_k,R_k]\in[i,j]$ and $X_k=m$, then ignore this transition.
 - Otherwise, assign the maximum to position $m$. Thus $dp[i][j]\mathrel{{+}{=}}{{{j-i}\choose{m-i}}\cdot{dp[i][m-1]}\cdot{dp[m+1][j]}}$.
 - (we select $m-i$ numbers out of the remaining $j-i$ to delegate to the range $[i,m-1]$, and the rest are assigned to the range $[m+1,j]$.)

We can check the condition for $[L_k,R_k]\in[i,j]$ and $X_k=m$ for all ranges with a fixed $j-i$ with sweep line. It takes $O(M)$ calculation for each value of $j-i$ so the total is $O(NM)$.

Dp is $O(N^3)$, so total is $O(N^3+NM)$.
