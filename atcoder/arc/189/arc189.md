## D. Takahashi is Slime
Define the "answer range" of $i$, to be the range of slimes that are absorbed when $K=i$. The answer for $K=i$ is the sum of all $A_i$ in this range.

Assume all values are distinct. For each index $i$, we may find the closest indices to the left and right of $i$ whose values are $>A_i$. Basically, these two indices define the range of slimes that are immediately able to be absorbed when $K=i$. Let this range be referred to as the "initial range" for $i$.

Suppose we construct a Cartesian tree to store the initial ranges (the initial range of $i$ is comprised of all nodes in the subtree of $i$). One property we can see is that for a node $i$, its answer range is a superset of the answer range for any descendants of $i$.

This gives us an easy construction for the answer. Let's say we have the answer range for some $i$. We can compute the answer ranges for the children of $i$ as follows:
 - Initialize the answer range for a child $j$ as the initial range for $j$.
 - If the sum of all $A$ in the initial range for $j$ is $>A_i$, then set the answer range for $j$ equal to the answer range for $i$.

The answer range for the root (base case) is $[1,N]$.

When not all values are distinct, we can map each $A_i$ to the pair $(A_i,i)$ (so that all values are distinct) and run the algorithm the same way. One caveat of this mapping is that the algorithm will compute incorrect answers for indices $i$ satisfying $A_{i+1}\ge{A_i}$ and $A_{i-1}=A_i$, so we manually compute their answers (which is just equal to $A_i$).

Complexity: $O(N)$.
