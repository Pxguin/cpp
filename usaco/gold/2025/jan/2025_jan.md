## 2. Reachable Pairs
Only problem I solved in contest, lol. 

Let $G$ be the original graph. When $s_i=0$, then we just delete the node; this will never add any new edges. These operations can be processed with DSU in reverse. When $s_i=1$, then all of the adjacent nodes will still be reachable from each other for all future operations. This property is not transitive.

For $s_i=1$, then we effectively don't change the reachability of adjacent nodes, so we actually don't even need to bother deleting this node. Only when $s_i=0$ does the reachability change, so ignore those for now. First, use DSU to merge all nodes satisfying $s_i=1$; this is the base graph (a more intuitive reason for this will become apparent later). Some of the nodes in this base graph might not exist in certain timestamps, so also store the amount of nodes that don't exist yet. We'll update this counter as we iterate in reverse over timestamps.

Since we have gotten rid of $s_i=1$, then we only process nodes satisfying $s_i=0$. For each of these nodes, we first unite it with all adjacent nodes $j$ in $G$, that currently exist (so $j>i$). 

We are forgetting some adjacent nodes however, specifically the ones that were made adjacent to this node through the deletion of a node $j$ satisfying $s_j=1$. All these nodes must have been adjacent to $i$ in $G$. So now, we can also unite this node with all adjacent nodes $j$ in $G$, such that $s_j=1$ and $j<i$ (doesn't exist yet). This is the reason that we store all the nodes that don't exist, because they are helpful in finding the other adjacent nodes.

Time complexity is $O(M\alpha(N))$.
