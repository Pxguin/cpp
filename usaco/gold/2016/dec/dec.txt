1 - Moocast

Binary search on X and do dfs to check if all the cows are in the same connected component (or binary search + DSU).
It takes N^2*log(max X) time both ways.


3 - Lasers and Mirrors

We can treat the x and y axes as vertices, so for every mirror it connects an edge between the vertices of its x and y axes.
Then we can run bfs from the x and y of the start mirror to get to the x or y of the end mirror.
