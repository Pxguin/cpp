The thing that I forgot the most while solving this problem is that words can repeat within sentences,
and sentences can repeat within a poem.

Firstly, observe that in the structure of the poem, the line order does not matter.
All we care about are the number of lines for every letter.

This leads us to the conclusion that we want to find the amount of possible lines of poetry ending with every rhyme scheme,
and then do some math to figure out how to permutate them to get the max amount of poems.


Part 1: Finding all lines
This is a simple DP (repeats allowed, unordered).
We then can just figure out for every word how many possible sentences end with it,
and then add it to a list (list X) containing for every rhyme scheme how many sentences are possible.


Part 2: Finding all poems
The amount of poems is simply the product of all the possible rhyme configurations.

Ex. ABA
The answer is the amount of unique ways to create AA multiplied by the amount of unique ways to create B.

For any given letter, the answer is simply the sum of x^y for all x, where:
 - x is an element in list X
 - y is the amount of lines ending with the given letter (AA: y = 2)
