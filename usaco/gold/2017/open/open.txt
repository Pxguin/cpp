3 - Modern Art 2

We must be able to store the 1d painting in a stack; otherwise it does not work.
 - (push the color into the stack at the first occurence, pop it at the last occurence).
 - If when we try to pop it the element isn't the top of the stack, it fails.
Some other observations:
 - The case 12121 should produce -1, so we need to make sure that if we push an element into the stack it doesn't show up again at a point where the stack has a larger size.
 - If there is a 0 then the stack must be empty.
The answer is simply the maximum size of the stack at any point.
