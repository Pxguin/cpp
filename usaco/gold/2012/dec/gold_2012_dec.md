## 2. First!
To start, for each string $i$, an $O(N)$ check can be done to see whether it can be lexicographically minimum in some permutation of the alphabet. First, if this string is a prefix of any other string, it's impossible. Otherwise, check it against all other strings $j$ to find the first position at which they differ. The character at that position, for string $i$, must appear earlier in the alphabet when compared to the character at that position for string $j$. All conditions are easily checked by building a graph with all 26 letters as nodes, and drawing a directed edge from the letter in string $i$ to the letter in string $j$. Then just see if a topological sort exists (i.e. acyclic). If it does, then string $i$ can be lexicographically minimum.

To speed up from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$, we can build a trie, as it easily lets us search up LCPs for strings (and thus lets us find the first position that two strings differ). Tries compress into letters, so the time complexity of checking for a string of length $i$ is only $O(26i)$. The total time complexity is only $O(\Sigma|S|+\Sigma^2N)$ where $|S|$ is the total length of all strings.
