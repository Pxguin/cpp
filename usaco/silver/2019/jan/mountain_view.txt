We want to find the number of mountains that are not contained within each other. 
 - Because all mountains are 45-45-90 triangles, we can work with the base intervals of every mountain without worrying about loss of information.
 - The base interval refers to the starts and ends of a mountain. A mountain with peak (4, 5) has an interval of [-1,9].
 - We can determine that for a mountain to be contained inside another mountain, its interval must be contained within another interval.

(L = mountain start, R = mountain end)
Observe that to be contained in a mountain, the L value must be greater than or equal to another mountain's L value. So we can sort a list containing the L of every mountain, and only check the R values.
 - We always compare a new mountain to the current mountain with the largest R value (we only care about the R values, the sorting accounts for the L values).

There are still two cases to consider:
 - What if two mountains have the same R value?
 - What if two mountains have the same L value?

If two have the same R value, it doesn't matter - one of them must be contained inside the other, because they have distinct L values.
If two have the same L value, then we will take the one with the larger R value. Note that one mountain will always be contained inside the other, and cannot be seen.
