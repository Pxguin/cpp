$7$ is prime, so the whole expression evalutes to true if any of the subexpressions $(B+E+S+S+I+E)$, $(G+O+E+S)$, or $(M+O+O)$ evaluate to a multiple of $7$. We can test if any of these sums are multiples of seven by adding up the modular residues of the variables for mod $7$.

Brute force over all possible mod residues, which is $7^7$, and test if that combination works. If it does, then add the amount of combinations of values satisfying those modular residues. This is calculated through permutations.

Letting the multiple we're trying to get be a prime $P$, and the number of variables be $V$, the time complexity is $O(N+P^V)$.
