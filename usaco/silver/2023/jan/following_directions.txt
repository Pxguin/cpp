For every sign, all cows passing through that sign obviously must follow the same path, and so end up at the same vat.
So when a sign changes, the amount of cows that change paths is the amount of cows that currently pass through that point.

Using this knowledge, we can store a frequency list for every point, including the vats. 

Then, for every query:
 - We want to erase the old path of the cows, so we take the frequency of the point (x,y), and follow the path until we reach a vat. For every point along that path, subtract that frequency. 
 - When reaching a vat, we will subtract that frequency * the cost of the vat from the answer, because this many cows are not going here anymore.
 - Then, we will flip the direction of the sign and trace the new path.
 - When reaching a vat, we add that frequency * the cost, because this many cows are now going to this vat.
