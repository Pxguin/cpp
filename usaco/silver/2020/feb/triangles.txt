Consider a brute force. For every point (denoted X) you find all the horizontal segments, and then:
 - find all the vertical line segments with the same corner X, and add each of the areas to the answer.

This can be optimized by the observation that you can just sum all the line segments for both horizontal and vertical.
We can find for every point the sum of these line segments with some math.
