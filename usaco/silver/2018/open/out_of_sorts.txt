Logically, the answer is the maximum X for every element,
 - where X is the amount of times 'moo' is printed until this element gets into its desired position.

But it is somewhat difficult to compute the position because there can be repeated elements.
 - To solve this, observe that distinct elements will be in the same order at the end as they started.
 - So we can do coordinate compression to convert the element into distinct numbers.
 - As an example, 1 2 1 becomes 1 3 2

So then:
 - If the element is to the left of the desired position, it
