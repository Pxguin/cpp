## 1. DFS Order
In the DFS tree that is formed, if the maximum node in the subtree of $i$ is $mx_i$, then for each $i$, all nodes in the subtree of $i$ are in the range $[i,mx_i]$ and vice versa.

$dp[i][j]$ is the minimum cost to configure the subtree of $i$ in order to satisfy the aforementioned property (where $j=mx_i$). Work backwards starting from the base case $dp[N][N]$, and return $dp[1][N]$ at the end.

It's pretty simple dp that takes $O(N^3)$ to compute.
