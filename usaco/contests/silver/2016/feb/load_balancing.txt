Similar to Rectangular Pasture, I use coordinate compression w/ 2d prefix sums to efficiently calculate any subsum.
Ths application is much simpler though.

After computation, you can do a complete search on the horizontal and vertical fence and use the prefix sums to
calculate the sum of the four rectangles.
