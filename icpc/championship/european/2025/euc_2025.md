## F. Mascot Naming
The following strategy works to identify if some string $t$ is a subsequence of some string $s$:
 - Initialize $last=1$.
 - Find the first occurence of $t_1$ in the range $[s_{last},s_{|s|}]$. Let this position be $p$. If no $p$ exists, stop here.
 - Pop the first letter from $t$, and set $last=p+1$.

$t$ is a subsequence if after these operations, $t$ is empty.

Now I introduce the following greedy strategy:
 - For all strings $s_i$ whose first character $s_1$ isn't equal to $t_1$, add $s_1$ to the end of the mascot name and pop the front character off $s_i$.
 - If no such strings of the above form exist, then all strings have first character equal to $t_1$. Add $t_1$ to the string, then pop the first character off $t$ and off all strings $s_i$.

If $t$ is empty at the end, then there is no solution. Otherwise, we have the mascot name as a solution.

The crux of the strategy is that we get rid of as many letters as possible before adding the next letter in $t$ to the string. It runs in $O(\Sigma|S|+|t|)$, $|S|$ being the concatenation of all $s$.
