## 4. Lane Switching
Comments: I shouldn't have spent this much time debugging. The most egregious case was that lines 31-32 were initially swapped, and it took me half an hour to debug that.

Binary search on the answer. Because all locations and lengths are integers, the answer is either of the form $x.5$ or $x.0$, so we only need precision to one decimal place. To check for a given $X$, extend all the car boxes by $X$ in both directions, and we just have to check if it's possible to reach lane $N-1$ without intersecting any of the modified car hitboxes. Now treat the gaps between adjacent cars in the same lane as nodes; we can draw edges between gaps in adjacent lanes if the ACM car can transition from the first gap to the second. Iterate over all adjacent pairs of lanes and use a 2p algorithm to draw all the edges, which is bounded by $2M$. After this, run a dfs from the gap of the ACM car and see if it can reach any of the gaps in the last lane (or use dsu). If so, then $X$ works. All this together produces an $O(MlogM+MlogR)$ algorithm.
