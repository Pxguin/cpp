## 2. Knapsack
Although there are up to $N$ different items, there are only $S$ possible weights, so group by weight. Also, we will only be able to take at most $\lfloor{S\over{i}}\rfloor$ items of weight $i$, so for each possible weight only consider the $\lfloor{S\over{i}}\rfloor$ items with the largest values. So the capacity of the shopping cart is $S$ and there are $SlogS$ possible items; from here a basic knapsack will suffice to calculate the answer in $O(S^2logS)$.
