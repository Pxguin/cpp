Define dp[i][j] to be the minimum space wasted for a slab with width i and height j.
By default, dp[i][j] = i*j. The base cases are for the N plates of size i,j, in which dp[i][j] will equal 0.

Then for every plate we can combine it with another plate to form a new, larger rectangle.
This means adding on all slabs with the same width as it (but possibly different heights), and separately, all slabs with the same height as it (but possibly different widths).
Although this takes O(H^2*W^2), we can speed this up to O(HW(H+W)),
by instead adding all slabs with the same width as it and smaller heights, and separately, all slabs with the same height as it but smaller widths.
