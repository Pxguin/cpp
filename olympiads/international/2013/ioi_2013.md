## 1. Dreaming
I think I just suck, because I could not figure out the optimal construction of edges.

For each tree, find the <i>center</i>: the node with the minimum maximum distance to another node in the tree. The maximum distance for the center is the <i>radius</i> of the tree.

Sort radii in decreasing order. For the largest two trees, it's clear that we want to connect their two centers with an edge. The longest path passing through this new edge is $r_1+r_2+L$, and we compare it with the diameters of the original two trees and take the maximum value.

For three trees: we can see that in an optimal construction, we connect the centers of the two trees with smaller radii to the center of the tree with the largest radius. This creates path lengths of $r_1+r_2+L$ and $r_2+r_3+2L$ for the new edges, respectively. Under the assumption $r_1>r_2>r_3$, we can see with casework that all other configurations are <b>strictly worse</b>.

Take for instance, connecting trees $1$ and $2$, and connecting trees $2$ and $3$. Then the path lengths are $r_1+r_2+L$ and $r_1+r_3+2L$, which is worse.

This reveals a key insight in the solution: simply connect the centers of all trees to the center of the tree with the largest radius. Then, just compute the diameter of the remaining tree.

All this takes $O(N)$.
