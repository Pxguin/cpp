## 2 - Mecho

Binary search on the latest time to leave the honeypot, $X$.
For a given $X$, we must check if there is some path from $M$ to $D$ only on grassy squares.
 - First let's do a multisource BFS from the hives to find the earliest time that any square gets covered by bees.
 - Then we can do a BFS from Mecho's spot. A spot is reachable if the earliest time we can get to it is less than the earliest time it is covered by bees.
