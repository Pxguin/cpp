## 2 - Mecho
Binary search on the latest time to leave the honeypot, $X$.
For a given $X$, we must check if there is some path from $M$ to $D$ only on grassy squares.
 - First let's do a multisource BFS from the hives to find the earliest time that any square gets covered by bees.
 - Then we can do a BFS from Mecho's spot. A spot is reachable if the earliest time we can get to it is less than the earliest time it is covered by bees.

## 3. Regions
Let the number of nodes belonging to region $i$ be $sz[i]$.

If $sz[r_1]\le{sz[r_2]}$, then we iterate over $r_1$. For each node with region $r_1$, we count the number of descendants with region $r_2$.

If $sz[r_1]>sz[r_2]$, then we iterate over $r_2$. For each node with region $r_2$, we count the number of ancestors that have region $r_1$.

Both can be done with Euler tour + binary search. Also, make sure to memoize queries. This ensures a worst case runtime of $O(NlogN+Q\sqrt{N}logN)$, when the size of each region is $\sqrt{N}$.
