# IOI 2005 Day 1

## 1. Garden
Solved similarly to <b>USACO Gold - Painting the Barn</b>; I will assume prior knowledge on how to solve that problem. We'll similarly go over all splitting lines, but calculating the best rectangles have a different strategy. Basically, we want to fix all left boundaries and find the minimum right boundary such that $K$ roses are contained inside the rectangle formed, as the min right boundary minimizes the perimeter. This can be accomplished by fixing the y-position and height of each left boundary. Then iterate over all x-positions for it by maintaining a sliding window to easily calculate the min right pointer. Therefore, $O(LW(L+W))$ runtime.
