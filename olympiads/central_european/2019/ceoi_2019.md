stupid and impossible, i need work on bitmask dp.

The graph must be a DAG. We can represent each unique graph by its lexicographically minimum topological ordering, and the goal is to compute the number of such graphs.

Letting the number of DAGs be $D$, the answer must be $M\cdot{\text{D}\over{2}}$ because for each dag, reversing all the edges produces a new dag and the sum of the costs for this pair equals $M$.

Let $dp[A][B]$ be the amount of DAGs with a prefix of their topological order being the set $A$, and the next index comes from set $B$. The transition is to select any index $C\in{A}$, and transition to $dp[A\cup{C}][B']$.

If we select $C$, we must remove all indices $[1,C-1]$ from $B$ as they cannot have indegree zero and thus cannot be the next selection for the topological sort, and we add all indices adjacent to $C$ to $B$. Thus, $B'=(A\setminus\set{1\dots{C-1}})\cup(adj[C]\setminus{A})$.

Time complexity is $O(N3^N)$.
