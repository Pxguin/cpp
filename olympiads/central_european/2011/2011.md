## 1 - Balloons

Given two balloons x and y with x to the left of y, if we know the radius of x we can find the radius of y with math.
Build a triangle with corners at the two centers. The hypotenuse is the sum of the two radii. Then we can solve for $r_2$ (second radius) if we know $r_1$.

$$(r_1+r_2)^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (r_1-r_2)^2$$
$$r_1^2 + r_2^2 + 2r_1r_2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1r_2$$
$$4r_1r-2 = (x_2-x_1)^2$$
$$r_2 = {(x_2-x_1)^2 \over 4r_1}$$

All that is left is to maintain a monotonic stack, because we know that for two balloons x and y, with x to the left of y,
if the radius of y >= the radius of x then x will never be the answer to any balloons to the right of y.

So our algorithm is to take the first element of the stack and find the radius (the min of our calculated radius and the upper limit on the balloon).
We store the minimum radius across all comparisons so far, R, to make sure this balloon does not intersect with any of the others.
Then while R is greater than the radius of the top element in the stack we pop it and compare the next element.
