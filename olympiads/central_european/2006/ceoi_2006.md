Optimal solution does not move left.

Optimal path from destination to start: move as far left as possible, then move up/down until it's possible to move left again.

Two key points for each rectangle, being top right and bottom right. Need to store min dist from these points to the endpoint.

The transition: take the current point (assume it's the top right) and draw a ray directly left, and figure out which rectangle it hits first (precalculate all with set). Transition to that rectangle.

$O(NlogN)$.
