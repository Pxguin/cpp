## 3. A Huge Tower

This problem is strange in that it never gives an explicit bound on $N$ except $10^9$? Anyways, for a block size $S$, you can place it on top of any blocks with size $\ge S-D$. So sort the blocks by increasing size then use a dp-ish relationship, where $dp[i]$ is the amount of ways to make towers with the first $i$ blocks. Then $dp[i]=dp[i-1]*B$ where $B$ is the number of blocks before block $i$ that block $i$ can be placed on. This is because for each of the $dp[i-1]$ ways to arrange the first $i$ blocks, you can insert block $i$ directly above any of the $B$ blocks in the tower (and it will still be valid).
