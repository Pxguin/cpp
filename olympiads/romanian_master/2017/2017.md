# RMI Day 1

## 2. Hangman 2
Unintuitive solution, or at least it is the first time I have seen something like this.

$N*K$ is constrained instead of just $N$ or just $K$. So if $N<K$ then we can run an $O(N^2K)$ algorithm, and otherwise we can run an $O(NK^2)$ algorithm. At worst, the runtime is when $N=K=\sqrt{NK}$ so the algorithm is $O(NK\sqrt{NK})$.

If $N<K$ then an $O(N^2K)$ algorithm works, meaning we can brute force over all pairs of strings and see if they differ by at most $2$ positions. Otherwise, we run an $O(NK^2)$ algorithm, so we can brute force over all pairs such that the characters are different at these spots. For two strings, we ignore the two characters at these positions because they are changeable, and check if the remaining parts of the string are equal. This can be done by checking the equality of the string hashes for those portions, which can be achieved by storing all unique hashes in a frequency array.
