## 3. Studentsko
This was solved on Kattis, where the contraints are $N,K\le{10^5}$ instead of $\le{5000}$.

Find the positions of each group of $K$ students in the original array. We can sort each group within these positions, and then the problem is reduced to sorting the array (or $K=1$). For example, take the best $K$ students, and find each of their positions. Now, reassign the skill levels such that the earliest index gets the highest skill level, the second gets the second, etc. I didn't know that the min operations to sort the array like this is pretty well known, but it makes sense to be $N$ minus the length of the $LIS$. This can be calculated in $O(Nlog(N+K))$.

Now that I see the official solution, you can just replace each student in the same team with the same number, and find the longest non-decreasing subsequence instead (this is much easier to think of...)
