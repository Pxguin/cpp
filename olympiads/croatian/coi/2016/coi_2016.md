## 3. Palinilap
A palindrome is either centered at a single index or at two adjacent indices. We first calculate all palindromes in the original string. This is done by fixing a center and then finding the longest palindrome with binary search and string hashing.

If we change a character, then we break all palindromes that it's a part of, except for palindromes centered <b>solely</b> at this index. So we can first use difference arrays to calculate the amount of these palindromes that each index is a part of.

Next, we want to calculate the amount of palindromes gained by changing each index to each letter. After this, we can just try all possible changes to easily get the answer.

We find the above while calculating the initial amount of palindromes. We permit ourselves to one mismatch when finding the longest palindrome, because we assume that the operation will be spent on changing one of the mismatched characters to the other. Thus, we get an answer for the amount of new palindromes formed by changing each index to each letter, and can now solve the problem. The time complexity, due to the binary search, is $O(NlogN)$.
