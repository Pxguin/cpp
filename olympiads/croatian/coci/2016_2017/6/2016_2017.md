This problem is another type of "you gotta have a eureka moment to find a very niche solution". It is clearly an MST problem. First remove duplicates because all cards with the same $P_i$ can be joined together for free. Then for each $P_i$ iterate over its multiples and take the closest $P_i$ to each of them; it is never optimal to connect all the other cards. Then do Kruskal's. There is a harmonic series which you can (kind of) approximate to $O(PlogN)$ although with $P \le 10^7$ it is a bit inaccurate; anyways, the total time complexity is $O(PlogN+Nlog^2N)$. There are at most $NlogN$ edges, and the $Nlog^2N$ comes from sorting. It is completely possible to avoid the sorting to run in $O(PlogN+NlogN)$ (for example, check the USACO guide solution) but I came up with this approach first and I really couldn't get that solution to work.
