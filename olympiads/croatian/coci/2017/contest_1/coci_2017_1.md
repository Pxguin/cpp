Build a tree on the rectangles; $a$ is an ancestor of $b$ if $a$ contains $b$. We can also find the strictest rectangle that contains each paintball; the paintball will color all ancestors of that node. So we each node we want to find the number of distinct colors in its subtree, which can be done with merging in $O(Mlog^2N)$.

To build the tree, sweep over the endpoints of each rectangle and maintain a set of currently visible rectangles. When coming across the left endpoint of a rectangle $i$, then its parent in the tree can be found through the following process:
 - Find the rectangle $j$ with the highest bottom endpoint, that is less than or equal to the bottom endpoint of $i$. This is a fundamental operation of a set and can be found in $O(logN)$.
 - The parent of $i$ is the closest ancestor of $j$ to $j$, that contains $i$.

That can be done in $O(log^2N)$ with binary search and binary lifting for the check, for a total time complexity of $O((N+M)log^2N)$.

The check can be simplified to $O(1)$ with a max sparse table instead of binary lifting, or by a segment tree? (I don't know how to do it). So $O(NlogN)$ for that part. Finding distinct colors can be done in two different (lengthier; both require Euler tour) ways in $O(MlogN)$ as well, so the problem could theoretically be solved in $O((N+M)logN)$.
