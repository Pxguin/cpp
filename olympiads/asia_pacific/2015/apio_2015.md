## 3. Palembang Bridges
WLOG assume there are no people satisfying $A_i=B_i$ because they will never cross a bridge anyways.

### K=1
Let the bridge be at position $L$. The cost for a person is $|S_i-L|+|P_i-L|$. This is equivalent to taking the array of length $2N$ of all $S_i$ and $P_i$, and doing [CSES - Sliding Window Cost](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1077) on it.

### K=2
A person will go to the bridge closer to the midpoint of $S_i$ and $T_i$, ${S_i+T_i}\over{2}$. Sort all people by $S_i+T_i$. We can iterate over all breakpoints $j$ such that all people $i\le{j}$ take the first bridge, and all people $i>j$ take the second bridge. This is reduced to solving the $K=1$ case for both halves independently and summing the results. Getting all these values in $O(NlogN)$ is done very similarly to the Sliding Window Cost problem.

Time complexity: $O(NlogN)$.
