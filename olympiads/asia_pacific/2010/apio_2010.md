For $K=1$: the problem is reduced to maximizing the length $L$ of a path in the graph, and the final answer is $2(N-1)-L+K$.

For $K=2$: maximize the sum of lengths $L_1+L_2$ of two disjoint paths, and the final answer is $2(N-1)-(L_1+L_2)+K$.

$K=1$ is easy dp, and $K=2$ is slightly harder dp. Either way, $O(NlogN)$ because we sort nodes at each depth to take the ones furthest away from each node (although it can be reduced to $O(NK)$ because we only care about the $K$ furthest nodes from each node).
