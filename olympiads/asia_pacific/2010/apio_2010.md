## 1. Commando
Let $dp_i$ be the maximum answer for a complete division of the first $i$ soldiers. Writing out the dp transition (let $ps_i$ be the sum of the first $i$ elements):
 - $dp_i=\max_{1\le{j}<i}[a(ps_i-ps_j)^2+b(ps_i-ps_j)+c+dp_j]$

Since $a,b,c$ are constants, post simplification we can use CHT to get the maximum value of this expression. In this specific problem, both slopes and queries are strictly increasing so it runs in $O(N)$.

## 2. Patrol
For $K=1$: the problem is reduced to maximizing the length $L$ of a path in the graph, and the final answer is $2(N-1)-L+K$.

For $K=2$: maximize the sum of lengths $L_1+L_2$ of two disjoint paths, and the final answer is $2(N-1)-(L_1+L_2)+K$.

$K=1$ is easy dp, and $K=2$ is slightly harder dp. Either way, $O(NlogN)$ because we sort nodes at each depth to take the ones furthest away from each node (although it can be reduced to $O(NK)$ because we only care about the $K$ furthest nodes from each node).
