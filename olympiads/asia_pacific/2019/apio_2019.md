Split the queries into $Q/B$ blocks of size $B$. For a certain block, isolate the set of (at most) $B$ edges that are updated in this block. Since all other edges have static weights, then for each query, it is only necessary to add at most $B$ edges in the DSU. After the query, roll back the DSU to get rid of these dynamic edges in preparation for the next query.

(To ensure that all static edges' weights satisfy the weight constraint for a query of type 2, process queries and edges in decreasing weight order)

Time complexity: $O({Q\over{B}}(MlogM+BlogB+MlogN)+QBlogN)$. $O({Q\over{B}}(MlogM+BlogB))$ comes from sorting queries and edges; $O({Q\over{B}}MlogN+QBlogN)$ comes from using rollback DSU.
