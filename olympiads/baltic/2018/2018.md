## 2. Genetics
For each clone, iterate over all positions. For each position, find the set of all other clones that differ in their genome at this position. If we combine all these together, then the resulting set should have $K$ copies of every clone (except the one we're testing). 

Combining all the sets can be sped up if we represent each clone with a unique prime number. Then for each position, the set of all clones differing in their genome can be represented as the product of all the primes in that set. If we multiply all these products together, then the final product should equal the product of all the primes (except the one we're testing) raised to the power of $K$. So this only takes $O(N(N+K)+NM)$.

My solution barely runs in time; it can also be optimized by assigning random numbers to every clone as to avoid having to precalculate primes. Hashing a set becomes the summation of all random numbers in the set. Edit: I did use summation and it reduced by 200 ms. For further optimization, I have two loops with $4NM$ complexity; doing more work in the first one can reduce the second down to only $NM$. Also, using sum means that $N(N+K)$ can be removed, which was initially dedicated to calculating the target hash for each clone.
