## 1. Graph
Solve [Atcoder - + Graph](https://atcoder.jp/contests/soundhound2018-summer-qual/tasks/soundhound2018_summer_qual_e) first.

WLOG assume only one component. Odd cycles can be solved in the same way (however there should always exist a solution in this case). The only difference with non-odd cycles is that we have to minimize the absolute sum of all vertices.

Increasing $i$ by $x$ decreases all nodes an odd distance away from $i$ by $x$, and increases all nodes an even distance from $i$ by $x$. If we disregarded the nodes an odd distance away, or vice versa, then the problem would easily be solved by subtracting the median from all nodes. To take into account the decreasing, we simply negate all the values of nodes an odd distance away; thus there is only one set of numbers to consider and we can easily calculate the answer.

Time complexity: $O(NlogN+M)$, because of sorting to find the median (or use quicksort to get $O(N+M)$...).
