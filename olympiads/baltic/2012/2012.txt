We can binary search on the answer, R. Then, we can draw a circle with radius R around every station.
Now, because we only consider points on the highway segment, we can calculate the endpoints of the part of the x-axis intersecting the circle.
This is equivalent to finding the length of a chord, which can be done with the pythagorean theorem.
We will denote these endpoints as X1 and X2.
Then, R works if there exists some point on the highway not contained in any segment (X1,X2) - it is fine if it is on the endpoints of a segment.

Note that the x-coordinates are given in sorted order, so for strictly increasing x coordinates, the coordinate X1 will strictly increase.
This means that we can store the largest X2 coordinate so far, and update it if some X1 < our X2 (meaning the two segments intersect). Then, the answer is if L >= the maximum X2.

However, for some pair of coordinates (a,b),(c,d) such that a = c and b,d < 0, the points are given as (a,b),then (c,d).
But the X1 coordinate for (c,d) is less than the X1 coordinate for (a,b). In these cases though, although the X1 point is less, the X2 point is greater.
So the segment for (c,d) contains the segment for (a,b), and thus it is simply fine to compare them in the order given.

Also, make sure to use doubles, as if you use long doubles then the extra computation for the square roots will time out.

Here is some not working code (because I first assumed X1 is always non-decreasing):

if (x1 > d) {return (d>=prev);}
else if (x1 >= prev) {return true;}
prev = max(prev, x2);

Alternative Solution (Mentioned in the usaco guide analysis).
Consider two points A and B, and draw the line segment from A to B (A,B). We can draw the perpendicular bisector of (A,B) and connect it to the x-axis.
The point where the bisector intersects the x-axis is equidistant to A and B. All points to the left of the perpendicular bisector are closer to A; everything to the right is closer to B. 
 - (Proof): Draw two points A and B (A is to the left of B), and draw the line segment AB and perpendicular bisector.
 - Label the point where it intersects the x axis D, and the point where it intersects segment AB as C.
 - Draw line segments AD and BD. Then triangles CDA and CDB are congruent, thus DA and DB are also congruent.
 - So the point is equidistant from A and B.

 - Let's draw a point on the x-axis to the left of D, labeled E. We will prove it is closer to A than to B.
 - ED is congruent to itself by the reflexive property, and DA and DB are congruent (proved earlier). 
 - Now we have two triangles, EDA and EDB. The distance to A, EA, is less than the distance to B, EB, if angle EDA is greater than angle EDB.
 - Clearly, if two sides of a triangle are congruent then the greater the included angle the larger the third side.
 - You can also use law of cosines: a^2 + b^2 - 2abcosC = c^2. In this case a and b are fixed, and across all points E the angles C are fixed.
 - The less the angle, the larger the result as cosine decreases from [0,180] thus the third side is longer.

 - Back to the proof: angle EDA is greater than angle EDB because line segments AD and BD share a common point on the x-axis and A is to the left of B; thus angle EDB contains angle EDA, so it is greater.

Consider three points A, B, and C (Ax<Bx<Cx), and draw the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments (A,B) and (B,C).
If the line segments intersect, then all points from Ax to Cx are closer to A and C than B, so B is irrelevant.
Thus we can store all the points in a stack.
