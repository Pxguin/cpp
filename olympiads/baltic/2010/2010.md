We want to partition the conductors such that in each set, none of the segments intersect. The goal is to find the minimum number of sets. Fix one endpoint by sorting by $X_1$, then two segments $a$ and $b$ intersect if the $X_2$ value for $a$ is greater than the $X_2$ value for $b$.

So, the minimum number of sets is the minimum number of increasing subsequences needed to cover all $X_2$. This is equal to the length of the longest decreasing subsequence (technically non-increasing subsequence, but $X_2$ are distinct). This is because to cover all elements, a greedy strategy is to assign each element to the sequence with the maximum last element whose last element is smaller than this one. If no such element exists, create a new sequence. It turns out that this is the same process as finding an LDS. So the time complexity is $O(NlogN)$.
