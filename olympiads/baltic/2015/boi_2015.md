# Baltic OI 2015 Day 2

## 2. Hacker
Optimally, each player claims a computer every turn so the hacker gets $M=\lceil{N\over{2}}\rceil$ computers and the operator gets the rest.

Whatever the hacker's first turn is, his final subarray must contain that initial computer. The operator can always force the hacker to get the minimum sum subarray (proof below). So the goal is to find, for each index $i$, the mininimum sum subarray of length $M$ containing $i$. The maximum across all indices is the answer.

This is best done by computing a sliding window sum array $S$, where $S_i=\sum_{i}^{i+M-1}v_i$. Now the answer for computer $i$ is simply expressed as an RMQ on this array, and we can find the answer for all computers in $O(NlogN)$ using a multiset/sparse table, or in $O(N)$ by using a deque (minimum queue).

Proof: assume $N$ is even, so the hacker and the operator both get $N/2$ computers. Arrange all computers into a ring, and imagine a division of the circle into two halves. One half contains Bytesar's initial computer. We can prove that the operator can always force Bytesar to get all computers in that half simply by mirroring Bytesar's moves on the other half of the circle. So, it makes sense that he wants Bytesar to get the half with the minimum sum. Virtually identical logic works when $N$ is odd.
