Two parts: the first is if escape is possible, and the second is finding the closest store.

### Escape
Root the tree at $E$, and let the endpoints of the blocked edge $i$ be $u_i$ and $v_i$. If $u_i$ and $v_i$ are both ancestors of $R$, then there exists no path from $R$ to $E$ and thus it's impossible to escape. This can be checked with a dfs (process queries offline).

### Closest Store
Assume WLOG that $u_i$ is the deeper node when compared to $v_i$. In this case, the stores we can access from $R$ must be limited to the subtree of $u_i$. For each node, compute the nearest store to $i$ in the subtree of $i$. Let that be $s_i$. The closest store to $R$, then, is the minimum value of $dist(R,x)+s_x$ for all ancestors $x$ of $R$ up to and including $u_i$ ($dist(R,x)$ is the distance from node $R$ to node $x$).

Subtract $dist(E,R)$ from each $s_x$ so that each $s_x$ transforms into $s_x-dist(E,x)$ (let this be $t_x$), and the problem is reduced to finding $min(t_x)+dist(E,R)$. This is a dynamic RMQ which can be done with binary lifting. Let $store[i][k]$ be the minimum value of $t_x$ for all ancestors $x$ of $i$, up to the $2^k$ th ancestor. So the time complexity is $O((N+Q)logN)$.
