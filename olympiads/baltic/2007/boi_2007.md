# BOI 2007 Day 2

## 2. Connected Points
Matrix expo.

## 3. Sequence
Suppose all values are distinct.

Greedy: for each $i$, find the nearest greater values on the left and right $l_i$ and $r_i$. The optimal strategy is to merge each of the ranges $[l_i+1,i-1]$ and $[i+1,r_i-1]$ into one element, then merge both elements with $i$.

$i$ is merged at most twice when $[l_i,i-1]$ and $[i+1,r_i]$ are both nonempty ranges. The amount of times $i$ is merged is equal to how many of the two ranges are nonempty. It's easy to check whether $l_i\ne{i-1}$ and $r_i\ne{i+1}$ and get the amount this way.

Proof that above only creates $N-1$ merges: it's equivalent to taking the Cartesian tree of the sequence. $i$ is merged with its children, so the amount of merges is proportional to the amount of nodes in the tree and therefore is $N-1$.

$O(N)$.
