# BOI 2017 Day 1

## 3. Toll
Ok an hour of debugging because I initialized my binary lift array log dimension to $16$ instead of $17$ (this is unrelated but it's dumb).

The graph is a DAG. Specifically, it can be divided into $N/K$ groups of $K$ nodes each. An edge can only exist between two adjacent groups.

The benefit of this is that we can consider the groups instead of nodes. We effectively build ourselves a line graph, and so it allows for binary lifting, where $lift[i][j][k][l]$ is the shortest path from group $i$, node $j$ to group $i+2^k$, node $l$ (i.e. node $Ki+j$ to node $K(i+2^k)+l$). This can be calculated in $O(K^3NlogN)$ and queries can be answered in similar fashion in $O(K^2OlogN)$, for a combined complexity of $O(K^3NlogN+K^2OlogN)$.
