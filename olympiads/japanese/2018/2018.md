## D - Commuter Pass

Because all edges on a minimum cost path from $S$ to $T$ effectively have weight $0$, we can rephrase the problem as going from $U$ to some node on a min cost path, then going to another node on that path (this costs $0$), then going to $V$. So we just have to find two nodes $(A,B)$ on a min cost path from $S$ to $T$ such that $dist(A,U) + dist(B,V)$ is minimized (where $dist(X,Y)$ denotes the shortest path between nodes $X$ and $Y$).

First, let's do Dijkstra from $U$, $V$, and $S$. 

Consider the graph consisting of all edges part of a min cost path from $S$ to $T$ (to find this, just backtrack from $T$). If we direct all these edges toward $T$ then the resulting graph is a DAG. For our two nodes $(A,B)$, we can fix every node $A$ $(dist(A,U))$ and for each $A$, find the node $B$ in the successors of $A$ such that $dist(B,V)$ is minimized. This can be done with topological sort and DP. After this we do the same thing, fixing $B$ and finding the min $A$.
