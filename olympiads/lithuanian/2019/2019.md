Let the indices of the poles that we leave unchanged be $b_1,b_2,b_3,\dots,b_k$. We want to maximize the length of $b$; the answer is $N-|b|$. For each adjacent pair $(b_i,b_{i+1})$ in $b$, we get to change all poles between $b_i$ and $b_{i+1}$ however we like. So, the following inequality determines whether it's possible to change those poles in a valid way:
 - The greedy strategy is to set pole $u+1$ to height $a_u+M$, pole $u+2$ to height $a_u+2M$, etc. Let $u=b_i$ and $v=b_{i+1}$. So the inequality we get is $(a_v-a_u)\le(v-u)m$.
 - Simplify to $(a_u-um)\ge(a_v-vm)$.
 - It's no different to $(um-a_u)\le(vm-a_v)$, but this equation is nicer to work with (as we'll see later).

From here, the answer is just the longest non-decreasing subsequence of an array $t_i$ where $t_i=im-a_i$. Additionally, we have to satisfy $t_i\ge{0}$ because we start at an unchangeable height of $0$ at coordinate $0$, so $0\cdot{m}-0=0$.

This can be calculated in $O(NlogN)$.
