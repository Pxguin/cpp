See official editorial for [CF 2050G - Tree Destruction](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2050/G). The amount of street segments that have to be closed for a path of length $k$ is the sum of degrees of vertices on that path, minus $2(k-1)$. That gives the number of edges incident to vertices on the path. Dp to find the maximum of these values is done similarly, with the same $O(N)$ time complexity.
