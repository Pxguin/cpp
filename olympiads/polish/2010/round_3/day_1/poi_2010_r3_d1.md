# POI 2010 Round 3 Day 1

## 3. Frog
We can solve this problem with binary lifting (as to decompose $m$ into powers of $2$). To do this, we need the base cases; we have to find the $kth$ smallest distance from each rock. This is done with a sliding window: we keep moving the window while it decreases the maximum distance.

Time complexity: $O(NlogM)$. To avoid MLE, the arrays have to be reused.
