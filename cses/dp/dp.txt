? - Grid Paths

dp[i][j] = # of paths to row i, column j.
dp[i+1][j] += dp[i][j], dp[i][j+1] += dp[i][j]. The answer is dp[n-1][n-1] (0 indexed).


? - Elevator Rides

Do bitmask dp. Define dp[i] as a pair, with the first number being the min amount of rides for this subset S of people.
The second number is the maximum space remaining given the first number in the pair.

For a subset S, we assume all numbers in the set are the last person added. 
So our candidate for dp[S] is {dp[S/i].first+1,X-weight[i]} if there is not enough weight left on the elevator,
and {dp[S/i].first,dp[S/i].second-weight[i]} if there is still enough weight to support person i.
