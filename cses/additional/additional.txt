? - Advertisement

For every height, find the largest width of the advertisement assuming this is the minimum height in the ad (then take the maximum).
 - This implies finding the nearest smallest values on the right and left side of each value, which can be done with a stack.
The max width of the ad for this height will be right-left+1.

? - Maximum Building I

This builds on the Advertisement problem. We can fix the bottom row and then calculate the maximum area like this similarly to the aforementioned problem.

? - Multiplication Table

Binary search on the median. To check, we make sure our value X is >= half of the values in the table.
Do to this, iterate over every row of the table and count the number of values that X is greater than or equal to with some basic math.
(If we are on row i, then X is greater than min(X/i, n) values)
