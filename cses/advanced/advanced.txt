?? - Meet in the Middle

Use meet in the middle to find all subsets, then combine them with lower bound.

?? - New Roads Queries

Make a graph with the weights of the edges as the time each road is created.
Then the answer for each query is the minimum maximum edge on a path from node A to node B, which can be done with a Min Spanning Tree + LCA.

Alternative Solution:
Use a persistent DSU and for each query binary search on the minimum time that nodes A and B are in the same component.
