The greedy solution is to construct the topological sort in the reverse order and pick the largest possible index at each point. $O(NlogN+M)$.

## Creating Offices
See solution to Baltic OI 2017 - Cat in a tree. An explicit construction is necessary here, but it's easy to extend to that based on how the solution to the BOI problem works.
