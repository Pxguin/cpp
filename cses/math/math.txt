?? - Exponentiation

Use binary exponentiation to find the answer. Store the current result as 1.
Namely, given the integer A and a power X, if X is even square the current result and divide X by 2; else multiply by A and subtract 1 from X to make it even.


?? - Exponentiation II
No clue how this works


?? - Prime Multiples
For every prime, compute all its multiples <= N and store these in a set.
The answer is the size of the union of all the sets, which can be computed with the Inclusion Exclusion Principle.
