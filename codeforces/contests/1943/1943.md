## C. Tree Compass
We can just solve the problem on the diameter of the tree, which will ensure that all vertices get covered. The diameter is a line, so solve for a line. This part is a greedy solution which is not too difficult to figure out. If there are an odd number of vertices then color from the middle vertice with distances $[0,\lfloor{n\over{2}}\rfloor]$, taking $\lceil{n\over{2}}\rceil$ operations. If it's even and is a multiple of $4$ then color from either of the two middle vertices with distances $[1,{{n\over{2}}-1}]$ and then get the remaining two nodes with one operation, so $n\over{2}$ operations. If it's even and not a multiple of $4$ then color from either of the two middle vertices with those distances, and then get the remaining two nodes with two operations, so ${n\over{2}}+1$ operations. It will take $O(N)$.
