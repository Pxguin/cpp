## D - Max Median

We can binary search on the median $X$, because for an interval, we can check if the median if valid if:
 - The amount of numbers $\ge X$ is more than the amount of numbers $< X$.
 - Note that the definition of median in this problem is different.

We can use prefix sums to quickly calculate for any interval $f(X)$ and $g(X)$.
 - $f(X)$ is the amount of numbers $\ge X$ 
 - $g(X)$ is the amount of numbers $< X$ 

Then, $X$ works if for some interval $(i,j]$ whose length is $\ge k$ ($j-i+1 \ge k$), $f(interval)-g(interval) > 0$.<br>
We can expand this to
$$f(j)-f(i) - (g(j)-g(i)) > 0$$
by storing prefix sums for $f(X)$ and $g(X)$. Then
$$f(j)-g(j) > f(i)-g(i)$$
Denoting $h(i)$ as $f(i)-g(i)$, we now have the inequality $h(j)-h(i) > 0$. <br>
We can fix $i$, and then we want to find the maximum $j$ such that the resulting subarray length is $>= k$.
To find the maximum, use prefix sums.
If we find a working value, then the median candidate $X$ works; otherwise it does not.
