## D. Friendly Spiders
Build a bipartite graph between spiders and primes, and BFS from $s$ to find the shortest path to $t$.

## E. The Human Equation
The effect on the prefix sum array is the same as increasing all the values contained in a set of disjoint intervals by $1$ or $-1$. The goal would be to get all values in the prefix sum array to $0$, so it's clear that the answer is the maximum of the prefix sum array plus the absolute value of the minimum. This simplifies to max minus min. We can calculate the prefix sum array and answer in $O(N)$.
