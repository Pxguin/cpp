## D. Blocking Elements
$S_1$: the sum of blocked elements. $S_2$: the max sum of the remaining subarrays.

As $S_1$ increases, the minimum possible value of $S_2$ decreases. Since the cost is $\max(S_1,S_2)$, then the function is convex and we can binary search on the minimum $S_1$ such that $S_2\ge{S_1}$ (i.e. the minimum point of the function; where the two functions intersect). Let it be $x$; then the optimal $S_1$ is either $x$ or $x-1$.

To compute the optimal $S_2$ for a given $S_1$: do dp. $dp[i]$ is the minimum cost of the blocked elements given we have considered up to and including $i$, $i$ is blocked, and no subarray before $i$ has a sum $>S_1$. It is easily done in $O(NlogN)$.

Total time complexity: $O(NlogNlog(\sum{A}))$.
