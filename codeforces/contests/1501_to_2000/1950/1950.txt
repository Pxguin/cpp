G - Shuffling Songs

Define dp[mask][i] as the min amount of songs removed for subset mask and last song i.
Then when adding a song to a subset, you can either add it to the end (if possible) or not add it to the end.
If you don't add it to the end then the last song stays the same, and you add one to the removed songs.
Otherwise the last song becomes the new song and you don't add anything to the removed songs.
