# Codeforces Round 913 (#1907)

## A. Rook
For a rook at row $i$ and column $j$, all squares it can move to must have the same row or have the same column. You can brute-force over all $64$ squares or iterate over all rows and columns separately. The first approach takes $O(N^2)$ where $N$ is the length of the grid and the second takes $O(N)$. But $N=8$, so it doesn't matter anyways.
