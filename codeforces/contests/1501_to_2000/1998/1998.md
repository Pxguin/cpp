## D. Determine Winning Islands in Race

Solve for a fixed start point $S$. Bessie moves in a fixed path, so she will lose only if Elsie can get to any islands $>= S$ strictly before Bessie can. We can BFS to find the shortest paths to all islands $< S$; Bessie never travels to them so they are all accessible to Elsie. Then for all islands $< S$ check to see if they have any islands $>= S$ in their adjacency lists, and if so update the min distance to those islands. There's no need to traverse the adjacency lists of any islands $>= S$ because for an island $>= S$, if Elsie gets there before Bessie then she already wins, so we can stop there. If she doesn't get there first then she is eliminated at this island, so we can't traverse the adjacency list of it. 

Now for this $S$ we have the minimum distances ($d[i]$) to the islands, and it's left to check if there's some $d[i]$ such that $i-S>d[i]$ (if there is then Elsie wins). So rearrange to $d[i]-i-S>0$, then calculate all $d[i]-i$ and store in a multiset. Elsie just needs to beat Bessie to one island to win, so we want to consider the max in the multiset.

We solved it for one $S$; it is a pretty easy transition to solve it for all $S$ (iterate over $S$ in increasing order and update the distance array for index $S-1$ and all nodes adjacent to $S-1$ in each iteration). Because of the multiset it takes $O(NlogN)$.
