# CF Global Round 23

Fenwick tree can be used to check the number of occurences of each value for each query.

Checking $r-l+1$ values (and thus maintaining $r-l+1$ fenwick trees) is not feasible though. But note that if the property holds, then the sum of all $a_i$ from $l\le{i}\le{r}$ is divisible by $k$ as well and thus only requires a single fenwick tree.

Checking if the sum is divisible by $k$ sometimes produces a false positive, and will do so deterministically. So the idea is to make it nondeterministic.

Random hashes can be generated for each value in the array and then it remains to check whether the sum of hashes is divisible by $k$. It has a $1\over{k}$ probability of producing a false positive, which is maximized as $1\over{2}$ when $k=2$. So all that is necessary is to run around $25$ trials, and the probability of failure is now $1\over{2^{25}}$.

If there are $T$ trials, then the time complexity is $O(T(N+Q)logN)$.
