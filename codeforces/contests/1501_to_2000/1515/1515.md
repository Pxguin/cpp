# CF Global Round 14

## F. Phoenix and Earthquakes
Here is how to check if a set of $N-1$ edges can be built (and if so, find an order to build):
 - First do greedy from the leaves up in a dfs: if this node has enough asphalt to build the road connecting it to its parent, then build it and pass the remaining asphalt to the parent; else, do nothing.
 - At the end, there is some leftover asphalt at the root. Do a second dfs down from the root to build all the remaining roads that were unable to be constructed in the first dfs.

So only the total sum of asphalt matters. Specifically, there's a solution if and only if $\sum{a_i}\ge{(n-1)x}$, and performing the above process on a spanning tree of the graph gives the answer.

Time complexity: $O(N+M)$.
