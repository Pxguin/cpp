## E. Range Minimum Sum

The solution covers an (I think) $O(N)$ solution using cartesian trees but I'm unfamiliar with them, so I will cover my greedy $O(NlogN)$ solution instead.

First we will for every element assume it is the minimum (find all ranges where it is minimum), so find the nearest smaller values with a stack. If we sum these up we get the initial answer without removing any elements.
Now when you remove an element there are three things you have to consider: the element itself, elements with this as a nearest smallest value, and elements with this inside their $(l,r)$ nearest smaller value range.

The element itself: Subtract the amount this single element contributes to the answer.

Elements with this as a nearest smaller value ($i=l$ or $i=r$): we need to calculate second nearest smallest values (as either $l$ or $r$ will change), and then just find the difference between this outcome and the original. This is where the $logN$ factor comes from as to do this we need to use a set. If we can do this some way in $O(N)$ then the total runtime is $O(N)$.

Elements inside the range ($i$ is in some range $(l,r)$): if $i$ is in the left side of the range subtract the right side, and vice versa. We can do this with prefix sums.
