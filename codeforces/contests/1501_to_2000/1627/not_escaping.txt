All that matters is the endpoints of the ladders, so we treat those two as nodes and then find all possible edges.
In my code, I compress them down to a 1d array. Then, we run Dijkstra.

However, the ladders have negative edge weights. To solve this, we can instead calculate the min distance to reach
every floor instead of every node, thus ensuring the negative weights are considered at the start of every Dijkstra.
To implement this, I store a priority queue for every floor and iterate through them, so N dijkstras in total.
