## G1. Ruler (easy version)

Estimate: idk, probably like $1000$

We can simplify the query from an $a*b$ rectangle to a $1*b$ rectangle. Let this be $f(b)$. For all numbers $< X$, $f(b)$ returns $b$, and for all numbers $\ge X$, $f(b)$ returns $b+1$. So just binary search on the lowest $b$ such that $f(b) = b+1$, which will be equal to $X$. This takes $O(log_2{1000})$, which rounds up to $10$ queries.

## G2. Ruler (hard version)

Estimate: $1500$?

We can't query a $1*b$ rectangle because we only have $7$ queries. To speed it up we need to query an $a*b$ rectangle, and let $f(a,b)$ be the given result. To effectively query for two values $a$ and $b$, we divide the search space into three parts, and $a$ and $b$ are the two mids. The complexity is $O(log_3{1000})$ which rounds up to $7$ queries.

Given $a \le b:$
 - If $f(a,b) = ab$ then $X > b$. 
 - If $f(a,b) = a(b+1)$ then $a < X \le b$. 
 - Else, if $f(a,b) = (a+1)(b+1)$, then $X \le a$.
