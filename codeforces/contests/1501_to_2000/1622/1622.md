## C. Set or Decrease
The process is to decrease the minimum element of the array $a$ times, then set the $b$ maximum elements to the minimum element. 

We can fix $b$ because $b\le{N}$. Instead of subtracting from the minimum and then setting all $b$ maximums to it, we can set all $b$ maximums to the minimum and then subtract from all $b$ elements simultaneously. This gives us a very simple formula for finding the minimum $a$ needed for this $b$, such that the sum becomes $\le{K}$. Across all $b$, we can take the minimum value of $a+b$.

Because of sorting, the time complexity is $O(NlogN)$.
