## D. Cases

A set of cases works if among every $K$ consecutive letters there appears at least one letter in the set. Also, the set of cases must contain the last letter in the string. So we'll for every $K$-length substring store a bit string of length $C$ denoting whether each letter appears in it ($A_i$). Then our goal is to find a set of cases with the smallest size that intersects all of these strings. More formally, find a bit string $B$ such that the popcount of $B$ is minimum and that $A_i\&B \ne 0$ for all $A_i$ (and also, it contains the last character of the given string).

Instead of testing whether a bit string is good let's test whether it's bad. This is because while a bit string $B$ must satisfy all $A_i$ to pass, it fails if it doesn't satisfy just one $A_i$. We can find all these strings by finding all strings containing each $A_i$'s one bits as a subset, then the inverse of these strings won't work. Do this by iterating from $0$ to $2^C$ and if this string contains an $A_i$, then individually turn on each of its bits and mark those as containing $A_i$. Time complexity: $O(CN+C2^C)$.
