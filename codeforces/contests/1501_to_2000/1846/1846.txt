F - Rudolph and Mimic

We're forced to do nothing until the mimic transforms. This would be indicated by a different set of objects compared to the previous round.
Once it transforms, then we can be confident which object type the mimic is (the count of that type should have increased).
Thus we get rid of all other objects. After this, we stall for another two rounds until the mimic transforms again, and now we can identify it.


G - Rudolph and CodeVid-23

The problem statement is a bit ambiguous in that it doesn't specify if some medicine can be used more than once, but yes it can.
Now the constraint on n is <= 10, so we can iterate over all 2^10 bit strings and for each one try every medicine.
Then we have a graph, so we just need to find the shortest path from Rudolph's initial string to the node with value 0 (with dijkstra).
