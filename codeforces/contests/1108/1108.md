## F. MST Unification
All MSTs have exactly the same edge weights (proof by contradiction).

Group all edges by weight. The only way to possibly get a different MST is to process the edges in a group in a different order. We're using Kruskal's, so groups can be calculated independently, because no matter the order of the group, the same components are formed after processing all edges in the group.

Given this, we can just see for each edge in each group, whether there exists some ordering of the group such that the edge is added to the MST. The easy way to do this is to order the group such that this edge is first. So, we basically just test all edges against the current MST to see if they can be added, but don't actually add them if it's possible (this is the same thing as assuming it's first).

After this, actually add edges to the MST. The same components are formed, so it doesn't matter which order we add edges in.

At the end, denote the number of edges that don't belong to the final MST, but could have been in the MST, as $D$. Each edge only needs to be incremented once, as this effectively moves them to the next group, where they are useless now. The group it was initially in will still produce the same components no matter if this edge was in that group or not, so processing this edge after that group means that it can't be added to the MST. So, the answer is $D$.

$O(MlogM)$ for sorting.
