We can only start at a vertex $i$ with $a_i=0$. Let the current component size be $s_i$. In this case, a vertex $j$ that is adjacent to the component can be joined into the component if $s_i\ge{a_j}$. After this, update all nodes adjacent to $j$. Maintain a priority queue to pick out the smallest $a_j$ value.

The key is to be able to simulate the process from every vertex $i$ simultaneously. This is possible, because if there are two components $i$ and $j$ such that an edge connects one node from each component, then $i$ and $j$ can always be combined into one larger component. Maintain each component and its priority queue with a DSU, then iterate over all $i$ with $a_i=0$ and run the algorithm on this component, merging others as necessary. Once we can't progress anymore, move on to the next $i$. Then, it works if the whole graph is one component at the end. Small to large merging produces a time complexity of $O(Nlog^2N)$.
