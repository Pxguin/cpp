# Codeforces Round 916 (#1914)

## B. Preparing for the Contest
We want an ascending sequence of length $K+1$, so Monocarp will get excited $K$ times. Then the rest of the numbers should be in strictly decreasing order. You can do this by taking the last $K+1$ numbers and printing them in increasing order, then printing the rest $N-K-1$ numbers in decreasing order. This yields an $O(N)$ algorithm.

## C. Quests
Assume you complete all quests up to the $ith$ quest once. Then for the leftover $K-i$ quests it's optimal to repeat the quest with the maximum $b$ value out of all quests you've completed so far. This is the solution: for all $i$ compute this value and then take the max. It's easy to do this by just iterating over $i$ in increasing order. It takes $O(N)$.
