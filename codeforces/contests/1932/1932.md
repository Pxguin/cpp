## G. Moving Platforms
Run Dijkstra on the graph; clearly, it's always better to get to a platform as early as possible. All we need to figure out are the edge weights between platforms. 

Let the time be $t$, and we're at platform $i$ trying to get to $j$. The current heights are $(l_i+ts_i)\mod{H}$ and $(l_j+ts_j)\mod{H}$; denote these $c$ and $d$. The equation we're solving for is the minimum non-negative $x$ such that the two heights are equal after $x$ more units of time; that is, letting $a=s_i$ and $b=s_j$, $ax+c\equiv{bx+d}\pmod{H}$. It simplifies to $(a-b)x\equiv{d-c}\pmod{H}$, which is a linear diophantine equation.

If $a-b=0$, then $x=0$ if $d-c=0$, and otherwise there is no solution. Otherwise, the linear diophantine equation is technically $(a-b)x+Hy\equiv{d-c}\pmod{H}$, so reduce the equation by $g=gcd(a-b,H)$ to get ${a-b\over{g}}x+{H\over{g}}y\equiv{d-c\over{g}}\pmod{{H\over{g}}}$.

There is no solution if $d-c$ is not divisible by $g$. Otherwise, we have ensured that ${a-b\over{g}}$ is coprime to ${H\over{g}}$, so the minimum non negative value of $x$ is given by multiplying the equation by the modular inverse of ${a-b\over{g}}$, which can be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm. The time complexity is $O(Mlog(N+logH))$.
