## C. Little Girl and Maximum Sum
Use prefix sums to calculate, across all queries, the amount of times that each element gets added ($f[j]$). We can rearrange the array in any order, so it's optimal to get the maximum sum by placing the maximum $a[i]$ at the position of the maximum $f[j]$ (so that it gets added the most), and so on for all $a[i]$. The constraints allow an $O(N+Q)$ solution but sorting is easier, so $O(N+Q(logN))$.
