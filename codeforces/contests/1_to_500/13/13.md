# CF Beta Round 13 (#13)

## E. Holes
Divide the array into blocks of size $\sqrt{N}$. For each index compute its block and the first index it will reach that is not in its current block. With this, also store the number of jumps it takes and the last jump it makes before reaching that block.

All that is done with a right to left dp.

This solves the issue of updates, as we only have to recalculate for all indices in the block of $a$. Queries can be done by simply simulating with our dp (skip) array, as we consider at most $sqrt{N}$ blocks. So the time complexity is therefore $O((N+M)\sqrt{N})$.
