## A. Greg and Array
We just have to store the difference array of $a$ to take care of range updates. If each operation was performed once, we could just add $d[i]$ to $a[l[i]]$ and subtract $d[i]$ from $a[r[i]-1]$, as is how the difference array works. But with the queries, each operation may not be performed just once. But we can just use prefix sums to find the amount of times each one is performed, call it $x[i]$, and add/subtract $d[i]*x[i]$ instead. The runtime is $O(N+M+K)$.
