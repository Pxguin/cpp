B - Two Sets

If A = B then just set B to infinity (or some arbitrary unreachable value) to simplify things.
We can draw two graphs where two nodes are connected in the first if their sum is A, and in the second if their sum if B.
Then we want to start at a node only present in graph A or B; this is the only set it can be in.
Relax this node in both graphs, and remove all connections to it. Then find another node only present in one graph, and continue.
If at any point no nodes exist but you haven't gone through all nodes, then it fails.

Alternate solution: 
Use DSU to connect two nodes with weight A or weight B depending on if they add to A or B.
Then we can prove that if all the nodes in a connected component can belong to set A and/or B, then there is a valid assignment.
Otherwise, no assignment exists.
 - Proof: if all nodes are connected by weight A except for a single node, then it is impossible to satisfy that node because its complement cannot be in both sets A and B simultaneously.
