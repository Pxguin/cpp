## D. Distance in Tree
A path between two nodes either wraps around a subtree or doesn't. So let $dp[x][k]$ denote the amount of nodes in the subtree of $x$ that are of distance $k$ to it. These values are calculated with simple dp. The amount of paths that don't wrap around $x$ is equal to $dp[x][K]$. For finding the paths that do wrap around, permute the $dp$ values of the children of node $x$. $O(NK)$ runtime.
