By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, a right triangle is formed if two of the three points are diametrically opposed. So first calculate all pairs of these points; denote it $p$. Now we'll iterate over the amount of pairs such that both nodes are the same color; for no triangle to be formed, no other node can share these colors. So for an iteration over $i$ pairs, we have ${{}^{p}C_i}$ ways to choose $i$ pairs, and ${{}^{M}P_i}$ colorings for each one, as each pair must have a different color for no triangles to be formed. For the remaining $N-2p$ nodes that aren't part of any pair, there are $M-i$ possible colors. For the $2(p-i)$ nodes part of a pair, they must have different colors so there are $(M-i)(M-i-1)$ possibilities for each pair. Therefore, for each $i$, we add ${{}^{p}C_i}*{{}^{M}P_i}*(M-i)^{(N-2i-(p-i))}*(M-i-1)^{(p-i)}$. When using binary exponentiation, the runtime should be $O(NlogN)$.
