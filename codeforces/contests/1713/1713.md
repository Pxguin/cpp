## E. Cross Swapping
Each cell $(i,j)$ can only be in two locations $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ by the swaps $k=i$ and $k=j$. We want to process cells in lexicographical order, and satisfy this cell if possible. Basically, if $a_{i,j}<a_{j,i}$, then we want to swap these two cells (that means we must use exactly one of $k=i$ and $k=j$), and if $a_{i,j}>a_{j,i}$ we don't want to swap these two cells (that means we use none of both of $k=i$ and $k=j$). 

It's easy to check these constraints with a DSU. Make two copies of each node; node $i$ represents if we use the swap $k=i$ and node $i+n$ represents not using the swap. If we want to swap $a_{i,j}$ with $a_{j,i}$, then we  merge $(i,j+n)$ and $(i+n,j)$, if $(i,j)$ or $(i+n,j+n)$ are not in the same connected component (this would contradict with this swap). Not swapping it follows similar logic. We can't do this if $(i,j+n)$ or $(i+n,j)$ are already merged, and we will merge $(i,j)$ and $(i+n,j+n)$ to show this constraint.

Using DSU makes the time complexity $O(N^2\alpha(N))$.
