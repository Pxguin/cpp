Build the solution one block at a time. When processing block $i$, let the time until it disappears be $t_i$. Initially, it's set to $a_i$. $t_i$ will obviously increase if we find a suitable block of the same $b$ to merge this one into. So while this block can outlast blocks before it or merge into another block of the same $b$, we will process these operations and update $t_i$ as necessary. Once no more operations are possible, then we stop. All these can be maintained with a stack; time complexity is $O(N)$.
