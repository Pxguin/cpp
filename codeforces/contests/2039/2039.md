## B. Shohag Loves Strings
If there are two adjacent equal characters, then the amount of distinct substrings is $2$ so it's ok. If there's three adjacent distinct characters, then the amount in this substring is $6$ so it's also ok. Otherwise, the string must consist of two distinct alternating characters (or be of length $1$, in which case it's clear that it doesn't work). For any substring (length $n$) of these strings, the amount of unique substrings is $2n-1$ because there are $2$ unique substrings for each length up to $n$, except for length $n$ where there's only $1$ unique substring. Therefore, for these cases there is no solution. Checking these conditions takes $O(|S|)$.
