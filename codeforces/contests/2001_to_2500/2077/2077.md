## E. Another Folding Strip
The fold operation is equivalent to selecting a subsequence of indices with alternating parities.

Negate the values at all odd indices in $a$. The operation is now equivalent to selecting a subsequence with alternating parities, and incrementing values at even indices in the subsequence by $1$ and decrementing values at odd indices the subsequence by $1$ (or the other way around, depending on the parity of the first value in the subsequence).

Since the goal is to make all values zero, then we can completely ignore all the constraints on the operation (it can be seen that this will not improve the answer). The new operation: select any subsequence and decrease all values at odd indices by $1$, and increase all values at even indices by $1$, or the other way around.

1775E (the human equation) is just this problem.

This problem requires the sum of the answer across all subarrays, but based on the solution of the above problem it is easy to extend to all subarrays with monotonic stack.
