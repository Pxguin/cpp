holy fucking shit

All vertices depth $n-1$ from en, then depth $n-2$, etc.

My first real probability problem requiring mod inverses. I figured out a handful of useful properties:
 - ${a\over{b}}\cdot{c\over{d}}\equiv{ab^{-1}cd^{-1}}\pmod{998244353}$
 - ${a\over{b}}+{c\over{d}}\equiv{ab^{-1}+cd^{-1}}\pmod{998244353}$

Thus each fraction $p\over{q}$ can be substituted with $pq^{-1}$.

For each node find the probability that it becomes a leaf (i.e. that exactly one of its neighbours doesn't fall and this node doesn't fall, similarly to [USACO 2019 - Cow Dating](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=924)).

The expected value formula can be decomposed into the following sum: for each unordered pair $(u,v)$, add the probability that $u$ and $v$ both become leaves to the answer.

If $dist(u,v)>2$, then $u$ and $v$ becoming leaves are independent events.

If $dist(u,v)=2$, then they depend on the node between them. Either it doesn't fall and all other neighbours of $u$ and $v$ fall, or it doesn't fall and exactly one other neighbour of both $u$ and $v$ don't fall (so that they are leaves).

If $dist(u,v)=1$, then the combined set of neighbours of $u$ and $v$ (excluding $u$ and $v$ themselves) must fall.

The details of how to efficiently compute them are not important imo; $O(NlogMOD)$
