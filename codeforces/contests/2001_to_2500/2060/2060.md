## F. Mutiplicative Arrays
Most of the numbers in $a$ will be $1$. In fact, there are at most $\lfloor{log_2{N}}\rfloor=16$ non-one numbers. We can precisely fix the amount of non-one numbers, then use basic combinatorics to add back in the ones.

So we fix the sum $x$ and also the amount of non-one numbers $L$. We want to calculate the number of arrays of length $N$ satisfying these constraints. First we must calculate the amount of arrays of length $L$ multiplying to $x$ (denote $c_L$), which can all be precalculated with a knapsack in $O(Klog^2K)$. Then the amount of arrays of length $N$ is $c_L(\sum_{i=L}^{N}{N\choose{i}})$. The binomial coefficient sum is simplified with hockey stick and thus we get $c_L{N+1\choose{L+1}}$. This binomial coefficient is further simplified to ${(N+1)!\over{(N-L)!}}/(L+1)!=(\prod_{i=N-L+1}^{N+1}i)/{(L+1)!}$ This can be computed by naively multiplying out the first term and then multiplying by the modular inverse of $(L+1)!$.

The answer is the sum of that expression across all $x$ and $L$. Thus, we can get the answer in $O(Klog^2K)$.

## G. Bugged Sort
Define a horizontal swap of $i$ and $j$: swap $a_i$ with $a_j$ and $b_i$ with $b_j$. Define a vertical swap of $i$ and $j$: swap $(a_i,b_i)$ and $(a_j,b_j)$.

Observation 1: Under the constraints, we can perform any horizontal swap using only Alice's swap function. To swap $i$ and $j$, perform the three swaps $(i,j),(i,k),(j,k)$ where $k\ne{i,j}$. Since Alice's swap is a horizontal plus a vertical swap, this means that we can also perform any vertical swap by only using the function.

Inverting an index $i$ refers to swapping $a_i$ and $b_i$. Since two inversions make a vertical swap, the answer is yes if and only if we can invert an even number of indices, then sort both arrays simultaneously by rearranging the indices via horizontal swaps.

Observation 2: Let $a'$ and $b'$ be the sorted versions of $a$ and $b$. Let the order of the indices that make up $a'$ and $b'$ be $s_1,s_2,\dots\,s_N$. This means, $(a'_i,b'_i)$ either equals $(a_{s_i},b_{s_i})$ or $(b_{s_i},a_{s_i})$.

The permutation $s_1\dots{s_N}$ holds for any valid $a'$ and $b'$, as it must be that the permutation is sorted by $\min(a_i,b_i)$. So we have an explicit order of indices, and now need to figure out if an even number of inversions can be made as to sort both $a$ and $b$. Do this with easy dp.

So $O(N)$.
