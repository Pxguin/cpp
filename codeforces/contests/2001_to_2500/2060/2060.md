## F. Mutiplicative Arrays
Most of the numbers in $a$ will be $1$. In fact, there are at most $\lfloor{log_2{N}}\rfloor=16$ non-one numbers. We can precisely fix the amount of non-one numbers, then use basic combinatorics to add back in the ones.

So we fix the sum $x$ and also the amount of non-one numbers $L$. We want to calculate the number of arrays of length $N$ satisfying these constraints. First we must calculate the amount of arrays of length $L$ multiplying to $x$ (denote $c_L$), which can all be precalculated with a knapsack in $O(Klog^2K)$. Then the amount of arrays of length $N$ is $c_L(\sum_{i=L}^{N}{N\choose{i}})$. The binomial coefficient sum is simplified with hockey stick and thus we get $c_L{N+1\choose{L+1}}$. This binomial coefficient is further simplified to ${(N+1)!\over{(N-L)!}}/(L+1)!=(\prod_{i=N-L+1}^{N+1}i)/{(L+1)!}$ This can be computed by naively multiplying out the first term and then multiplying by the modular inverse of $(L+1)!$.

The answer is the sum of that expression across all $x$ and $L$. Thus, we can get the answer in $O(Klog^2K)$.
