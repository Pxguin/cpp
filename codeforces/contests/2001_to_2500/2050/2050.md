## F. Maximum modulo equality
If $x\equiv{y}\pmod{m}$, then $|x-y|\equiv{0}\pmod{m}$. So for the given range $[l,r]$, the answer is $gcd(|a_{l+1}-a_{l}|,|a_{l+2}-a_{l+1}|,\dots,|a_r-a_{r-1}|)$. I use square root decomposition to calculate gcd range queries, but a sparse table is arguably the best option. Mine runs in $O((N+Q)\sqrt{N}logA)$.

## G. Tree Destruction
Root the tree at node $1$. There are two cases: the path extends from node $i$ into $i$'s subtree, or starts from a descendant of $i$, passes through $i$, and reaches another descendant of $i$. The second case is simply a combination of two paths of the first case, so we can just find the maximum amount of components formed by a path of the first type for each $i$. 

There are two possibilities when calculating this value: either we start a new path at node $i$ or extend a path of one of the children. Then to calculate the answer, we consider the best one-path and two-path combinations for each node, and take the maximum across all nodes. 

Let the amount of components that a path forms be $c$. For the one-path case for node $i$, we consider the path with the largest $c$. For the two-path combination for node $i$, it's optimal to combine the two paths that have the maximum two values of $c$.

This dp can be done in $O(N)$.
