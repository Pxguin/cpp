# Educational Codeforces Round 172

## D. Recommendations
Assume that all ranges are distinct. If there's two equivalent ranges then the answer for those users is both $0$.

For each user $i$, let the set of indices whose range contains $i$'s range be $S_i$. For $j\in{S}$, the answer for $i$ is $(\min(r_j)-\max(l_j)+1)-(r_i-l_i+1)$.

We will first calculate $\min(r_j)$ for each user $i$ (denoted $R_i$). Sort users by increasing left endpoint; if there are ties, sort by decreasing right endpoint. This is to ensure that when processing a user $i$, then we have already processed all users $j$ that could contain $i$. Specifically, if we store the set of all $r_j$ so far, then all users $j$ satisfying $r_j\ge{r_i}$ must contain $i$ as a range, so $R_i$ is just the minimum $r_j$ that's $\ge{r_i}$.

Repeat to calculate $\max(l_j)$ for each user. The sorting gives a time complexity of $O(NlogN)$.
