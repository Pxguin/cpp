## G. Shorten the Array
Use a sliding window approach. It is a well-known problem solved using a trie, that given an array $a$ and a number $x$, we want to query the maximum value of $x\oplus{a_k}$ for some index $k$. Define $f(a,x)$ to be this function.

So iterate over all $i$. First, add $a_i$ to the window; i.e. advance the right pointer by one. Let the left pointer of the window be $l$. Then while $f(\text{window},a_i)\ge{k}$, update the answer with the value $i-l+1$, and advance the left endpoint of the window by one.

This runs in $O(NlogA)$.
