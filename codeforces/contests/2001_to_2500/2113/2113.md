# CF Round 2113

## D. Cheater
Consider binary search on the answer $X$. Then take the prefix of length $X$ of the player's hand and the prefix of length $N-X+1$ of the dealer's hand. $X$ works if the player can get through all $X$ cards before the dealer can get through $N-X+1$ cards.

The player wins if and only if the minimum in the player's deck is greater than the minimum in the dealer's deck. So the best possible swap is to replace the minimum value in the player's deck with the maximum value of a card in the length $N-X$ suffix of the player's deck that wasn't considered in the binary search.

Binary search is unnecessary at this point and the process can be done for all $X$ in $O(NlogN)$ by using sets, or $O(N)$ with prefix/suffix maximums/minimums.
