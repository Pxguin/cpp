## F. Choose Your Queries
By greedily processing queries, each value of $a$ oscillates between $0$ and $1$. If we choose $p=i$ an even number of times, then $a_i=0$ at the end; otherwise, $a_i=1$.

Draw an edge between $x_i$ and $y_i$ for each query, and the goal is to direct each edge such that every node has an even indegree. This is in fact equivalent to [CSES - Even Outdegree Edges](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2179).

Time complexity: $O(N+Q)$.
