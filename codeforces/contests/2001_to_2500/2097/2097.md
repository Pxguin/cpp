## C. Bermuda Triangle
This is pretty much a harder version of [1993F1 - Dyn-scripted Robot (Easy version)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1993/F1).

The same process follows: when hitting a side, instead of reflecting the airplane's velocity vector, reflect the triangle across the axis that the plane passed through. This results in a tiling of the plane with triangles, and the vertices of the triangle correspond to any point $(x,y)$ satisfying $x,y\equiv{0}\pmod{N}$.

Finding the first time that the airplane hits a vertex is equivalent to finding the earliest $k$ satisfying the following:
 - $ka+x\equiv{0}\pmod{N}$
 - $kb+y\equiv{0}\pmod{N}$.

Solve with Chinese Remainder Theorem. Now the goal is, consider the tiling of the plane, to find the amount of lines that the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(ka+x,kb+y)$ intersects. By decomposing the lines into horizontal, vertical, and diagonal, and calculating each part independently and summing the results, we get the answer in $O(idk)$ total.
