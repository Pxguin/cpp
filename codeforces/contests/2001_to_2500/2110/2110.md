# CF Round 1026 (#2110)
seems like (really) easy div2 if F was this easy (maybe like 30-40 min)

## F. Faculty
Assume WLOG $x<y$. If $x>{y\over{2}}$ then $f(x,y)=y$; otherwise, $x+(y\mod{x})$. So the solution is as follows:
 - $M_i=\max(a_1,\dots{,a_i})$
 - If there is a number $j$ such that $j<i$ and ${M_i\over{2}}<a_j<M_i$, then the answer is $M_i$.
 - Otherwise: if the maximum remains the same ($M_i=M_{i-1}$), update the answer with $a_i+(M_i\mod{a_i})$. And if the maximum changes, update the answer with all $f(j,i)$ for all $j<i$.

That last part takes $O(N)$ brute force, but runs at most $O(logA)$ times, so the time complexity of this solution is $O(NlogA)$.

More: it's also worth it to note that $f(x,y)<2\min(x,y)$. So after removing duplicates from $a$: the brute force can be cut down on. Let the second maximum be $M_{i,2}$. Then it's only worth to brute force $j$ satisfying $j<i$ and ${{M_{i,2}}\over{2}}<a_j\le{M_{i,2}}$ which is at most $\min(N,{M_i\over{4}})$ values. This means the total number of operations is $O(\sum_{i=0}^{log_2{10^9}}{min(N,{2^i\over{4}})})\approx O(10N+5.2\cdot{10^5})$ operations when $N=10^6$. In practice, this is slower because it requires an $O(NlogN)$ sort and set but code is there too.
