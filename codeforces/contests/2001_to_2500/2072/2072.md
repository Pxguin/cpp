## G. I've Been Flipping Numbers for 300 Years and Calculated the Sum
If $p\ge{N}$ then $rev(N,p)=N$.

For all $2\le{p}\le{\sqrt{N}}$, brute force. 

This is because for all $\sqrt{N}<p\le{N}$, the bit representation in base $p$ has length $2$. The two values, from most to least significant, are $\lfloor{N\over{p}}\rfloor$ and $N-p\lfloor{N\over{p}}\rfloor$. So the value of $rev(N,p)$ is ${p\lfloor{N\over{p}}\rfloor}+p(N-p\lfloor{N\over{p}}\rfloor)$. We can fix the value of $\lfloor{N\over{p}}\rfloor$ and then calculate the value of this expression through arithmetic sums.

The time complexity of both parts is $O(\sqrt{N})$ (according to editorial), so the total time complexity is also $(\sqrt{N})$.
