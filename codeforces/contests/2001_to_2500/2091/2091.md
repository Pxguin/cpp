# CF Round 1013

## G. Gleb and Boating
Store $dp[i][j]$ as the min/max cell reachable when first achieving power $i$, given the cell has a position equivalent to $j$ mod $i$. The usefulness of this is seen by the fact that power $i$ is a valid candidate for the answer if we can reach a square $j$ equivalent to $s\pmod{i}$ when first achieving power $i$, and it turns out that it is only necessary to store the maximum/minimum reachable squares, depending on the direction of Gleb.

The transitions are quite confusing. We transition from $i$ to $i-1$, and so need to make some number of strokes at power $i$ before turning to get power $i-1$. Assume WLOG that we move left with power $i-1$, and thus $dp[i]$ stores the maximum reachable squares by power $i$, and we need to find the minimum reachable squares to fill in $dp[i-1]$.

For each stroke of power $i$, Gleb moves $i$ to the left, so the modular residue of his position taken mod $i-1$ decreases by exactly $1$. Given this, for each $dp[i][j]$, it transitions to a range of $dp[i-1][j_2]$. We can then calculate all $dp[i-1][j_2]$ by sweeping over all these ranges and using a multiset (or two priority queues) to select the minimum.

Time complexity: $O(K^2logK)$.
