# CF Round 1034

## G. Modular Sorting
For any $(i,k)$, $a_i\mod{m}\equiv(a_i+k)\mod{m}\pmod{\gcd(k,m)}$. Define $g=gcd(k,m)$. We can divide all numbers $0$ to $m$ into $m\over{g}$ blocks of size $g$ each.

Set all $a_i:=a_i\mod{g}$. After sorting, the values $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$ will be in the same block iff $a_i\le{a_{i+1}}$. Thus there exists a solution iff there are $<{m\over{g}}$ adjacent inversions in $a$.

Since only $2\sqrt{m}$ values of $g$ exist, the solution takes $O((N+Q)\sqrt{M})$.

## Comments
G: Should have solved in ~15 minutes, but I thought too fast and jumped to the conclusion that I needed to count inversions, not adjacent inversions. (Also during implementation I made a stupid TLE mistake).
