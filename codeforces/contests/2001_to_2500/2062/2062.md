## E1. The Game (Easy Version)
Cirno must pick such a node $i$ on her first turn such that Daiyousei can still make a move after. Out of the set $S$ of all such $i$, it's optimal to select the $i$ with the maximum $w_i$, which forces Daiyousei to select a node that is not in $S$. Therefore, Cirno wins on the next turn.

$i\in{S}$ if and only if the maximum weight of a node outside the subtree of $i$ is strictly greater than $w_i$. These maximums can be calculated with dp, and the total answer in $O(N)$.
