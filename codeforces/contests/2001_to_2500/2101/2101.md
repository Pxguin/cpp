## D. Mani and Segments
Since the LIS and LDS share at most one element, and when that happens then $LDS(b)+LIS(b)=|b|+1$, then... the LIS and LDS share exactly one element, and their union has size $|b|$.

Fix that element $i$. Given that the LIS and LDS intersect at $i$, then both the LIS and LDS can be uniquely (greedily) determined (for example the element in the LIS right before $i$ is the largest $j$ satisfying $j<i$, $a_j>a_i$, the next element is the largest $k$ satisfying $k<j$, $a_k>a_j$, etc.).

But it also must be that their union has size $|b|$. So find the minimum left bound $L_i$ such that the union of the LIS and LDS cover all elements in the range $[L_i,i]$. Find the maximum right bound $R_i$ as well such that the union covers $[i,R_i]$, and it can be said that any segment $\in[L_i,R_i]$, and containing $i$, is cute.

As $i$ increases, $L_i$ is non-decreasing. If $a_i>a_{i-1}$, then the LIS for $i-1$ up to $i-1$ remains unchanged but the LDS may be disrupted. If $a_i<a_{i-1}$ then similar logic applies.

To calculate the intersection of all the $[L_i,R_i]$ answers: this is a well known problem (area of rectangles) whose generic form is solved using segment tree. But exploiting this observation (that as $i$ increases, both $L_i$ and $R_i$ are non-decreasing) gives an easy way to solve it in linear time.

The total time complexity is $O(N)$.
