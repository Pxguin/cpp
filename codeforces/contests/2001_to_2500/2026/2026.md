## E. Best Subsequence
Minimizing the amount of ones is equivalent to maximizing the amount of zeroes. So we construct a bipartite graph $G$ where an edge exists between $i$ and $j$ if the $j$ th bit of $i$ is off.

We can see a selection of bits $B$ and indices $A$ constitutes a valid subsequence if for each element $i\in{B}$, there exists the edge $i\leftrightarrow{j}$ for $j\in{A}$. The best subsequence is the selection of $B$ and $A$ with maximum combined size.

The above precisely describes a complete bipartite subgraph of $G$. To find the subgraph with the maximum amount of vertices, note that it is the same size as the maximum independent set of $G'$. In turn, we can see that this is the complement of the minimum vertex cover in $G'$, which by Konig's theorem has equivalent cardinality to the maximum matching of $G'$. So compute the maximum matching, and use its size to compute the answer.

With Kuhn's algorithm, this runs in $O((NlogA)^2)$ per test case.
