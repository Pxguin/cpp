## G. Build an Array
I think this problem has revealed to me just how much of an issue my slow implementation speed is.

The minimum number of operations is $N$. We aim to find the maximum number of operations $M$ and check if $N\le{K}\le{M}$.

Let $L$ be the index of the first element in $a$ that we decide to construct in the array. For all $i<L$, $i$ is constructed after $i+1$, and for $i>L$, $i$ is constructed after $i-1$.

$L$ is the first constructed, and the maximum number of operations to construct $L$ is the maximum power of $2$ that $L$ is divisible by.

Then solve for the maximums when $i<L$ and $i>L$ for each $i$, and sweep over $L$ with prefix/suffix sums to get the max number of operations for each value of $L$ (and $M=\max{L}$).

$O(N)$, because finding the max power of $2$ that divides each $a_i$ is the bottleneck and (because it's just the least significant 1 bit of $a_i$) can be done in $O(1)$.
