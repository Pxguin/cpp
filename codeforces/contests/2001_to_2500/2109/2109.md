# CF Round 1025 (#2109)

## C1. Hacking Numbers (Easy Version)
Digit sum reduces by the most. So taking the digit sum twice reduces $x$ to the range $[1,16]$. Subtract $8$, $4$, $2$, $1$ in succession so that it's guaranteed that $x=1$. Then, multiply by $N$. It takes $7$ operations in total and $O(1)$ per test case.

## C2. Hacking Numbers (Medium Version)
Multiply by $9$. Since the digit sum will be divisible by $9$ if $x$ is divisible by $9$, then applying the digit sum twice reduces $x$ to $9$. Then add $N-9$.

$4$ queries, $O(1)$ per test case.
