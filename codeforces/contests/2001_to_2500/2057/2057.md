I just lost an hour of debugging time because I used resize instead of assign. This might be the dumbest mistake that I've ever made.

If we have fixed a maximum and a minimum then the goal is to minimize the length. This means that the maximum and minimum are at the endpoints of the optimal range.

We can see that assuming $a_r$ is the max and $a_l$ is the min, we can rearrange to $(a_r-r)-(a_l-l)$. It's clear that if $a_r$ isn't the maximum in the range, then the answer produced will always be suboptimal. Same thing with $a_l$. Also, if $a_l$ is the max instead of $a_r$, then the answer is negative which is also suboptimal. So for this case, we just compute $a_i-i$ for each index (denoted $v_i$), then take two indices $i$ and $j$ ($i<j$) such that $v_j-v_i$ is maximized. It's equivalent to taking the maximum $v_j$ and the minimum $v_i$, such that $i<j$.

Across queries, we can simply use a segment tree to store the mins, maxes, and also the answer for each segment.

To deal with $a_r$ being the min instead of the max, we can just reverse the array and rerun the algorithm. This now puts $a_r$ at the right of the range without changing any of the values, and so it's a valid method for dealing with the second case.

Time complexity is $O(NlogN)$. My perception of the difficulty is completely skewed, but I would say that it's slightly underrated. However, I have zero practice with segment tree so it might be a skill issue.
