## E. Nested Segments
Let's say $M=0$. Casework yields the following result: add the segment $[1,N]$, and then add two segments $[1,k]$ and $[k+1,N]$ (for any $k$), and recursively repeat the process for those two segments. That is, to split the current segment into two segments, add both segments to $T$, and then repeat for those two segments. This is the only method to add the maximum amount of segments. We can view this as a full binary tree with $N$ leaves, so the number of ways to add the maximum amount of segments is just $C_{N-1}$ which is the $(N-1)th$ Catalan number.

The answer to the problem, formally, is the number of full binary trees with $N$ leaves, such that the segment corresponding to each node either completely contains $[l_i,r_i]$, is contained by $[l_i,r_i]$, or is disjoint from it. We can deduce from the optimal strategy that there must exist a node whose segment is exactly equal to $[l_i,r_i]$.

So we can reduce the tree to only the nodes corresponding to $[l_i,r_i]$, then run dp. $dp_i$ is the amount of ways to configure the subtree of $i$. Also, let $len_i$ be the length of the segment for node $i$. If $i$ has no children, then $dp_i=C_{len_i-1}$ as the subtree of $i$ has $len_i$ leaves. If $i$ has children, then just compress the children's ranges into points and use the Catalan numbers on the result. Specifically, let $L=len_i-\sum{len_x}$ for all children $x$ of $i$. $dp_i=C_L\cdot{\prod{dp_x}}$.

This solution runs in $O(NlogN)$. A remotely similar problem is [CF 1830C - Hyperregular Bracket Strings](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1830/C).
