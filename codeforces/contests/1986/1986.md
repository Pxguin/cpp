## F - Non-academic Problem

The number of pairs won't decrease if we remove an edge (from $U$ to $V$) in a cycle, because there is simply a second path from $U$ to $V$. In other words, we want to find the number of edges not in a cycle, (bridges), and for each one try removing it.<br>

Initially I came up with a complicated spanning tree (Kruskal's, to find one edge in every cycle) + LCA (binary jumping, to find the full cycle) in order to rule out all edges in a cycle. Trying to remove all bridges ($U,V$) is pretty easy, just permutate the number of vertices below $V$, and also above $U$, in the spanning tree.

But we can instead use Tarjan's existing [bridge-finding algorithm](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/71146).
The second part is done in the same way as before.
