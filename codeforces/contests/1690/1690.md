## G. Count the Trains
Find the amount of initial trains. Note that the speed of each train is determined by the head of the train, and that the speeds of the trains are strictly decreasing. So when decreasing the speed of a carriage, we first figure out if it forms a new train (i.e, it is slower than the carriage before it). Then we'll look at all trains after it and merge them into this new train if they happen to be moving faster than or equal to its speed. 

This works because all queries can only decrease the speed of trains. $O((N+M)logN)$ because we maintain a sorted set for storing trains.
