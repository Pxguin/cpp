## E. The Three Little Pigs
For some query $x_i$, we are to find $\sum_{j=0}^N{3j\choose{x_i}}$. Let the sum of every term ${i\choose{x}}$ satisfying $i\le{3N}$ and $i=j\mod{3}$ be stored in an array $ans[x][j]$. The answer for each query $x_i$ is then stored in $ans[x_i][0]$.

The reason we do this is because we can now use Pascal's identity to get a couple recurrence relationships: 
 - $ans[x-1][1]=ans[x][0]-ans[x][1]$.
 - $ans[x-1][2]=ans[x][1]-ans[x][2]$.
 - $ans[x-1][0]=ans[x][2]-(ans[x][0]-{3N\choose{x}})+{3N\choose{x-1}}$, or more intuitively, $(ans[x][2]+{3N+1\choose{x}})-ans[x][0]$.

We can store the base case as $ans[3N]=\set{1,0,0}$. It runs in $O(N+Q)$ after we have precalculated binomial coefficients.

Note: this dp can be simplified further (look at tourist's solution for example).
