## E. Money Buys Happiness
$dp[i][j]$ equals the maximum amount of money remaining, given that we are at month $i$ and have $j$ units of happiness so far. We can either choose to buy the current unit of happiness or not buy it, so there are two transitions. The answer is the maximum value of $j$ such that $dp[M][j]$ is an achievable state. The time complexity is $O(M\sum{t_i})$ per test case.

## G. Money Buys Less Happiness Now
This is just an easier version of [USACO - Job Completion](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1451). If I solved this problem before, then maybe I could have solved that one much more easily. 

We want to maximize the amount of months possible, so the following greedy approach works: store the current amount of money we have, and also the months that we've bought happiness on. Iterate through all months and greedily try buying the current unit of happiness. If our budget goes negative, meaning that it isn't possible, then out of all months that we've bought happiness on, we give up on buying the one with the highest $c_i$. This is done with a priority queue, and at most one removal is necessary so that our budget becomes positive again.

Time complexity is $O(MlogM)$.
