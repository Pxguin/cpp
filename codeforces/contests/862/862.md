## E. Mahmoud and Ehab and the Function

The function is $f(j)=|{\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}}(-1)^{i-1}*(a_i-b_{i+j})|$. We can split the $a$ and $b$ apart to rewrite it as:
$\begin{equation}\nonumber f(j)=|({\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}}(-1)^{i-1}*a_i) + ({\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}}(-1)^{i-1}*-b_{i+j})| \end{equation}$

The first summation can be precalculated in $O(N)$ time and the second can be retrieved with suffix sums after $O(M)$ precalculation. Then we can find $f(j)$ in $O(1)$ time - let's store all $f(j)$ in a set. When querying, we find the positive and negative value closest to $0$ and take the min.

For a query $i$, we know that if $r_i-l_i+1$ is even then the delta for each $f(j)$ is $0$, otherwise it is $x_i$. It will time out if we add this to all $f(j)$ in our set so we'll just maintain a total delta over all queries, $D$, and query for the two values near $-D$ instead of $0$. Implementation was pretty rough for me though. But anyways the runtime is $O((M-N+Q)log(M-N))$.
