## E. Control of Randomness (estimate: 2000)
First let's find the optimal strategy. By linearity of expectation, the expected value of the whole path is the sum of the expected turns to move past every node, that is on the path from $v_i$ to $1$. 

If the turn is even and we're at node $x$, and we don't move towards the root, then we'll move back to node $x$ the following turn for another attempt. The expected number of attempts at passing node $x$ is $C$, which denotes the amount of nodes adjacent to $x$ (I have a formal proof of this down below). Each attempt (except the final one) consists of moving away from and then back to node $x$, so the expected turns before success is $2C-1$. Also, if it's an odd turn then the expected value is just $1$.

It should be clear that we want to spend our coins on the $p_i$ nodes with the highest expected turns; each coin has the effect of reducing the expected turns to $1$. So run a dfs and change the highest $p_i$ values, achieving $O(NlogN)$ per query, for a total complexity of $O(QNlogN)$.

Here is a formal proof for the expected value. Assume $A$ is the probability of not passing this node and $B$ is the probability of passing, which is equal to $1-A$. We get the following formula for the expected number of attempts at passing node $x$:
$\begin{align}\begin{gathered}
E[x]={\sum_{i=0}^\infty{(i+1)(A^iB)}} \\
=B({\sum_{i=0}^\infty{\sum_{j=i}^\infty{A^i}}}) \\
=B({\sum_{i=0}^\infty{A^i\over{1-A}}})={\sum_{i=0}^\infty{A^i}} \\
={1\over{1-A}}={1\over{B}}
\end{gathered}\end{align}$

As $B={1\over{C}}$, the equation simplifies to $C$.
