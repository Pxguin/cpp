## F. Consecutive Subsequence
$dp[i]$ equals the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence ending at $i$. Transitions are pretty easy; just look for the maximum $dp[j]$ such that $a_j=a_i-1$. Do this with a map.

For each dp value, also store a pointer to the previous value in the subsequence. This lets us retrieve the subsequence at the end.

So, after calculating all dp values, then look for the maximum dp value. This is our answer for $k$. To restore the subsequence, just follow the pointers back to the beginning of the subsequence. $TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N)$
