C - Tenzing and Balls

Note that the answer is made up solely of disjoint intervals.
Define dp[i] to be the answer for balls 1...i, and last[i] as a boolean value storing whether dp[i] contained an interval ending at i.
In my code I store last[i] as an integer array but this is unneccesary.
dp[0] = 0.

Then we have some options for all i (uses push dp).
 - Make a new interval,
 - Extend an interval currently ending at i,
 - Do nothing.
