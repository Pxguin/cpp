## C. Sasha and Array
Segment tree... on matrices (support range multiply and range add). Range multiply is ok because of distributive property of matrix mult, very nice.

$O((N+M)(logN+logX))$. One necessary optimization is to explicitly represent 2x2 matrices with four variables instead of using vectors. I wonder when I'll start using segtree templates...
