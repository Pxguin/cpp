# CF Round 319 (#576)

## C. Points on Plane
$25\cdot{10^8}$ is slightly higher than $N\sqrt{N}$, so we can split the points into $\sqrt{X}$ blocks on the x axis. Inside each block, we either traverse points from top to bottom or bottom to top (in terms of y-coordinate) alternating for blocks as to minimize y-distance travelled (so for first block, travel top to bottom; for second, go bottom to top; etc.). 

So for each block, we travel at most $H$ in y-coordinate, and $\sqrt{W}$ from each point to each point. Thus, the total distance is $(N+H)\sqrt{W}$. This runs in $O(NlogN+\sqrt{W})$.
