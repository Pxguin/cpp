$dp[i][j]$ is the minimum amount of seconds needed to remove the range $[i,j]$. The base cases are for single characters ($dp[i][i]=1$) and adjacent characters ($dp[i][i+1]=0/1$ depending on if $c_i=c_{i+1}$). We can first split the range $[i,j]$ into two independent ranges $[i,k]$ and $[k+1,j]$, and delete them separately. So $dp[i][j]$ is the minimum of $dp[i][k]+dp[k+1][j]$. Alternatively, if $c_i=c_j$, then we can delete these two characters as part of a palindrome without incurring extra cost, by extending any existing palindromic deletion in the range $[i+1,j-1]$. Therefore, $dp[i][j]=dp[i+1][j-1]$. We get a time complexity of $O(N^3)$.
