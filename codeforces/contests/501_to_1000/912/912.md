# CF Round 456

## E. Prime Gift
Binary search on the answer â€” find the minimum $x$ such that there exist $\ge{k}$ integers $\le{x}$, with factorization contained inside $p$.

Meet in the middle can be used. For the set of the smallest eight primes, the amount of numbers $\le{10^{18}}$ with prime factorization contained inside that set is between $6$ and $7$ million. Use two pointers to combine both halves together in linear time.

$O((|A|+|B|)log10^{18})$, where $A$ and $B$ are the two sets for meet in the middle.
