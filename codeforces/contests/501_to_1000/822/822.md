This can be solved with dp. Let $dp[i][j]$ denote the maximum prefix of string $t$ that we can match, given that we have made $i$ pieces and have considered up to position $j$ in string $s$. Since we are checking if the answer is $\le{x}$, then $i$ is capped by $x$. Also, the motivation behind considering positions in string $s$ is because we have the freedom to skip positions in string $s$, but have to match every single character in string $t$.

There are two transitions. First, $dp[i][j+1]=dp[i][j]$ because we can choose to skip the current position. Otherwise, we can cut out a new piece. It's optimal to take the longest piece possible, so find the length of the LCP (longest common prefix) of the two strings that remain (which is $[j+1,N]$ in string $s$, and $[dp[i][j]+1,M]$ in string $t$). Let the length be $D$. Then, $dp[i+1][j+D]=dp[i][j]+D$. The LCP can be calculated by binary searching on the length and comparing equality in $O(1)$ with the hashes of the two strings. This results in a final complexity of $O(XNlogM)$.
