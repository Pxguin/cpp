## G. Two-Paths
$in_i$ is the best two path in the subtree of $i$, starting and ending back at $i$. It can be calculated as $in_i=\sum{\max(0,in_c-2\cdot{w(c,i)})}$ for children $c$ of $i$. The contribution from $c$ to its parent is $\max(0,in_c-2\cdot{w(c,par_c)})$; let that be $cont_c$.

Also calculate $out_i$ which is the best two path outside of the subtree of $i$, starting and ending back at $i$. It is calculated very traditionally.

For a query $(a,b)$, assume $a$ is not an ancestor of $b$ or vice versa. Let $c=lca(a,b)$. ??????????????????????????????????????/
