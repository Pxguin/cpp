# Educational Codeforces Round 3

## E. Minimum spanning tree for each edge
Build an arbitrary MST. For each edge in the MST, the answer for them is the weight of the MST. Otherwise, we can add the edge $(a,b)$ to the MST and remove the heaviest edge on the path between $a$ and $b$ (calculated with binary lifting), to turn it back into a tree.

Time complexity: $O(NlogN)$.

## F. Frogs and mosquitoes
Maintain a set of uneaten mosquitoes. The process is to find the earliest frog that can eat this mosquito; that is, the first frog satisfying $x_i\le{p_j}$ and $x_i+l_i\ge{p_j}$. Do this with a segment tree, by sorting frogs by $x_i$ and then querying the first frog satisfying $x_i+l_i\ge{p_j}$, and then checking if $x_i\le{p_j}$.

If we find such a frog, then update its tongue length and then continue eating out of the set of uneaten mosquito while possible. Otherwise, add this mosquito the set of uneaten ones.

So, the time complexity is $O((N+M)log(N+M))$.
