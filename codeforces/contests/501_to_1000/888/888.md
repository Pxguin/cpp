## G. Xor-MST
A solution is to divide and conquer on bits. Starting from the highest bit, split the numbers into two groups: having this bit turned off and having this bit turned on. Optimally, there is only one edge between two vertices belonging to opposite groups. So after computing the cost of the left and right groups then we need to connect these two components together with an edge of minimum cost. This is equivalent to finding a pair of numbers, belonging to opposite groups, with minimum XOR.

This can be done by iterating over the smaller group and finding in $O(logA)$ the best candidate in the second group (e.g. with a binary trie). To maintain groups, use small to large merging. So the time complexity is $O(NlogNlogA)$ and uses $O(NlogA)$ memory.
