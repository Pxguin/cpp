## D1. The Endspeaker (Easy Version)
Define $dp[i][j]$ as the minimum cost needed to remove up to (but not including) index $i$ in array $a$, given that $k=j$. First, $dp[i][j]\rightarrow{dp[i][j+1]}$ because we can choose to increase the value of $k$. The second transition is to remove a prefix of $a$, in which case it's optimal to remove the longest prefix possible. This can be calculated with some prefix sums & binary search. Assuming we want to remove up to prefix $x$, then we get the transition $dp[i][j]\rightarrow{dp[x+1][j]}$.

At the end, we return the minimum of all $dp[N+1][i]$, $1\le{i}\le{M}$. Calculating the dp with binary search gives a time complexity of $O(NMlogN)$.

## D2. The Endspeaker (Hard Version)
We additionally want to store for $dp[i][j]$ the number of ways to achieve this minimum. Because we want to count all the ways, it's not correct to remove the longest prefix possible anymore. Instead, let the possible range of prefix removals that can transition to $dp[i][j]$ be $[x_1,x_2]$ (transition to $dp[i][j]$ from any $dp[x][j]$ satisfying $x_1\le{x}\le{x_2}$). We want to find the sum of the number of ways to achieve the minimum cost when only considering $dp[x][j]$, which can be done with segment tree. The time complexity remains the same, $O(NMlogN)$.
