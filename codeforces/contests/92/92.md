## D. Queue
Process the walruses in increasing order of $a_i$, so when we process walrus $i$, all previously processed walruses are strictly younger than this walrus. Therefore, the best candidate for the farthest ahead younger walrus for $i$ is simply the previously processed walrus that is earliest in the queue. If that candidate is before $i$ in the queue, then we've found the answer. Otherwise, the answer for this walrus is $-1$ because no walruses in front of it are younger.

Complexity: $O(NlogN)$.
