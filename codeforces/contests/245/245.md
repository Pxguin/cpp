## H. Queries for Number of Palindromes
Do dp to check if some range is a palindrome â€” let $pal[i][j]$ be a boolean storing this information for the range $[i,j]$. $pal[i][j]$ is true if $s[i]==s[j]$ and the range $[i+1,j-1]$ is a palindrome, which is a dp transition. Afterwards, we can sum up the amount of palindromes in each range with inclusion exclusion. With $ans$ as the sum array, $ans[i][j] = pal[i][j]+ans[i+1][j]+ans[i][j-1]-ans[i+1][j-1]$. We get a complexity of $O(|S|^2)$.
