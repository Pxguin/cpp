# CF Global Round 13

## E. Fib-tree
The following process works to check if a tree is a fibtree: let the the current tree's size be $F_k$; then find <b>any</b> edge that divides it into two trees of sizes $F_{k-1}$ and $F_{k-2}$ and recursively check if both are fibtrees as well. This runs in $O(NlogN)$, specifically $O(Nlog_\phi{N})$.

It is necessary to prove that if a tree is a fibtree, then for any division of this tree into two trees of sizes $F_{k-1}$ and $F_{k-2}$, those two trees are also fibtrees.

It's easy to see how this can be proven by induction. The base cases are $k=0,1$. The outline is as follows:
 - A fibtree $T$ of size $F_k$ is constructed by connecting together, with an edge, two fibtrees $T_2$ and $T_3$ of sizes $F_{k-2}$ and $F_{k-1}$, respectively.
 - The only possible divisions of $T$ into two trees $T_4$ and $T_5$ (of sizes $F_{k-2}$ and $F_{k-1}$ respectively) as are follows: either divide it into $T_2$ and $T_3$ themselves, or $T_2$ is contained inside the larger tree $T_5$.

The first case is proven by the assumption of how we create $T$.

For the second, $T_5$ (having size $F_{k-1}$) can be viewed as connecting $T_2$ (size $F_{k-2}$) plus a subgraph of $F_{k-3}$ nodes from $T_3$ (size $F_{k-1}$); then $T_4$ is the remaining $F_{k-2}$ nodes from $T_3$. By induction, for any division of $T_3$ into two trees of size $F_{k-3}$ and $F_{k-2}$, those two trees are fibtrees, and thus $T_4$ is a fibtree. Since connecting any two fibtrees with an edge creates a fibtree, and $T_5$ is a combination of two fibtrees, then $T_5$ is a fibtree as well (and completes the proof).
