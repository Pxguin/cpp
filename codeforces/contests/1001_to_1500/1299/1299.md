Map the operation to the prefix sum array ($ps_i$) and graph the set of points $(i,ps_i)$. An operation $[l,r]$ is equivalent to mapping all points $l\le{i}\le{r}$ vertically onto the line from $ps_{l-1}$ to $ps_r$. So, it can be seen that to obtain the lexicographically minimum sequence, it suffices to do the operations corresponding to the lower hull.

Time complexity: $O(NlogN)$.
