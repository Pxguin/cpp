# CF Round 526

## E. The Fair Nut and Rectangles
Sort by $x_i$ and we find that $y_i$ must be strictly decreasing.

Let $dp_i$ be the best answer given the last rectangle chosen is rectangle $i$. The relationship is: $dp_i=\max_{1\le{j}<i}(dp_j+(x_i-x_j)y_i-a_i)$. Simplify and cancel out constants (values not dependent on $j$), and we get that it is necessary to maximize $dp_j-x_jy_i$.

This is just a line function with slope $-x_j$ and y intercept $dp_j$. Across all functions, we need to query the maximum value of a function at $x=y_i$. Taking advantage of the fact that $-x_j$ is a decreasing function, and the queries $y_i$ are decreasing as well, then we can use a deque to store the upper convex hull of all lines and get the line on the hull at x coordinate $y_i$.

Time complexity: $O(NlogN)$, from sorting, but the CHT (convex hull trick) takes $O(N)$ only.
