# CF Round 696

## C. Array Destruction
$x$ is monotonically decreasing. So one of the values we select must be the largest remaining value in the array. The second value can easily be deduced as $x$ minus that value.

So there is an easy $O(NlogN)$ check if we know the initial value of $x$. $x$ must be the sum of two values in $a$, one of which must be the largest value, so we can fix the other value for an $O(N^2logN)$ solution.
