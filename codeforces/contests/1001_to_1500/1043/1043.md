# F. Make it One
Under the given constraints every number has at most $6$ distinct prime factors, so the answer is at most $7$. We can try defining a dp array $dp[i][j]$ as booleans denoting whether you can get a gcd of $j$ with a subset of size $i$, but it is more flexible to define it as the number of ways to get a gcd of $j$ with size $i$.

For a given number to be a gcd of some numbers, all those numbers must divide this gcd. So for some $dp[i][j]$, find the amount of numbers in the given array that are multiples of $j$, denote it $c$. The initial answer will be $c\choose{i}$. Now we have to subtract the amount of subsets where the gcd is $>j$. But we know that because all subsets come from a pool of numbers that are all divisible by $j$, then all possible gcd candidates must be multiples of $j$. So we can subtract $dp[i][kj]$ for all possible integers $k$. It results in a time complexity of $O(NlogN)$.

Also, a mod has to be used in the dp, so there is the small chance that $dp[1]$ is congruent to $0$ with the mod. However the chance of failure is very low.
