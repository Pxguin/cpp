# CF Round 681 (#1442)

## C. Graph Transpositions
What the fuck I probably spent seven hours debugging (with countless methods e.g. staring at code and doing trial and error, reading editorial, asking chatgpt, making a random test case generator, rewriting my code from scratch like 3 times, and comparing with a correct submission that I found) and 29 WA submissions, because the part that I thought the Dijkstra code that was wrong actually wasn't wrong, and the simplest thing (taking the minimum of all answers) that should trivially be correct turned out to be wrong.

Since the amount of "token moves" $M$ is bounded by $M$, then once $K>log_2M$ then it is in our best interest to minimize $K$ first, and the amount of moves second.

For the first $log_2M$ values of $K$, we can brute-force the minimum cost needed with dp/Dijkstra. Then do another Dijkstra to compute the lexicographically minimum $(K,M)$ needed to reach node $N$ both when $K$ is even and when $K$ is odd.

Time complexity: $O((M+N)logMlogN)$.

Since I <s>stole cleaner code from someone while debugging</s> wrote two AC submissions, I left that the other one in as well in the "graph_transpositions_clean" file. Original = "graph_transpositions" file.
