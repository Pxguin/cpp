# Codeforces Global Round 9

## F. Integer Game
I will go over the strategy for player $1$.

WLOG assume $a<b<c$. Player $1$ can win in one move if $c-b=b-a$, and the last pile chosen was the pile containing $c$. In this case, we can query $c-a$ to force this amount to be added to $c$, so the pile containing $c$ is now the last pile chosen. So the new numbers $a',b',c'$ are $a,b,2c-a$ respectively. After this, we can force a win by querying $(c'-b')+(c'-a')$. We can't add to $c$, so must add to either $a$ or $b$. Either way we add, we get the configuration $b''-a''=c''-b''$, as the common difference is forced to be either $c'-b'$ or $c'-a'$. Additionally, the last pile chosen is the pile currently containing $c''$. So from here, we can win in one move.

The first query $c-a$ can be generalized. We did that to force $c$ to be the last pile added to. So if we again just query $(c-b)+(c-a)$, then if it is added to $a$ or $b$ then we obviously win in one move. So it must be added to $c$, and we can simply apply the same algorithm. Basically, player $1$ always wins.
