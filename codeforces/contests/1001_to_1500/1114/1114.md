I wanted to do some DSU algorithm initially, but dp works better. It should be clear that we should initially compress all preexisting connected components into a single cell; let the new array be $c$. Then, let $dp[i][j]$ be the minimum operations needed to merge the range $[i,j]$ into a connected component. $dp[i][j]=\min(dp[i+1][j]+1,dp[i][j-1]+1)$, if we choose to change the component color to $c_i$ or $c_j$ (respectively) to induct them into the component. If $c_i=c_j$ then we can induct both $i$ and $j$ into the component in one move, so also, $dp[i][j]=dp[i+1][j-1]+1$. Time complexity is $O(N^2)$.
