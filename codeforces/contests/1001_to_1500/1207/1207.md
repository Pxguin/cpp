## F. Remainder Problem
$N$ is the length of the array.

If $x\ge{\sqrt{N}}$, then brute force (sum up all values of $a_{kx+y}$) to get the answer to this query. This takes $O(\sqrt{N})$. 

We will precalculate queries satisfying $x<\sqrt{N}$ so that they can be answered in $O(1)$. A query of type $1$ updates at most $\sqrt{N}$ entries in the query precalculation array.

So, the time complexity of both queries is $\sqrt{N}$ and the total time complexity is $O(Q\sqrt{N})$.
