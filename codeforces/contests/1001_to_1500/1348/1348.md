# CF Round 638 (#1348)

## F. Phoenix and Memory
Finding one ordering can be done with greedy: iterate over labels in increasing order, and among all friends who haven't been assigned labels yet and can be assigned this label, assign it to the friend with the minimum $r_i$.

The claim: all valid orderings can be expressed as transformations of the ordering we found under the following operation:
 - Let the label of friend $i$ be $ord_i$. Create a graph of $N$ nodes, representing the $N$ labels. Draw a directed edge from $ord_i$ to all nodes in the range $[l_i,r_i]$ (excluding $ord_i$). Basically, it represents what other labels the friend with label $ord_i$ can take.
 - Find a cycle. For each label in the cycle, assign the friend currently with this label to the next label in the cycle.

So the ordering is unique iff there are no cycles. Conversely, if a cycle exists, then a cycle of length $2$ must also exist (because each node's adjacency list is a range of nodes).

This means that if the ordering is not unique, then we can always find a second ordering only by swapping two friends. This is pretty easy to do: iterate over friends in increasing order of label, and see if this friend can take on any previous label (and if the friend with that label can take on this label).

Time complexity: $O(NlogN)$.
