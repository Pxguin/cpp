C - Good Subarrays

Let us find the amount of good subarrays starting at each index l.
For every l, we want to find the amount of indices r such that the sum of elements between r and l is equal to r-l+1.
With prefix sums, ps[r+1]-ps[l] = r+1-l.
So ps[r+1]-r+1 = ps[l]-l. Convert the ps array to store the sum of elements 1..r - r.
