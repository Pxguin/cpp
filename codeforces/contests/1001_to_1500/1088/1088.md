## D. Ehab and another another xor problem
Miserable implementation; I just couldn't make it work for a long time, but cool algorithm. We should find bits for $a$ and $b$, starting from the most significant bit to the LSB. 

Here's how to figure out the bits for $a$ and $b$ at position $i$: 
 - First we assume we know all the states of all bits more significant than $i$, so xor these values with $a$ and $b$ such that $i$ becomes the most significant bit in the remaining numbers ($a'$ and $b'$). 
 - Next, assume WLOG that $a'>b'$. This can be queried by xoring with $0$. 
 - Note: the proof of the following statements can all stem from the fact that $2^i > {\sum\limits^{i-1}_{k=0} 2^k}$. Also, $c\oplus{2^i}$ inverts bit $i$ in $c$.
 - $a'>b'$, so if $(a'\oplus{2^i}) < (b'\oplus{2^i})$, then bit $i$ is on in $a$ and bit $i$ is off in $b$.
 - Otherwise, if $a' < (b'\oplus{2^i})$, then both $a$ and $b$ have bit $i$ turned off, and else they are both turned on.

This takes $3$ queries per bit, which won't work. However, we can find out if $a'>b'$ without having to query again. If $a'>b'$ and $(a'\oplus{2^i}) < (b'\oplus{2^i})$ and $a' < (b'\oplus{2^i})$, then for the next iteration, we can deduce that $a'<b'$ (and vice versa). If $(a'\oplus{2^i}) < (b'\oplus{2^i})$ does not hold true, then bit $i$ is the same value in both $a$ and $b$, so $a'>b'$ should not change for the next iteration.5
