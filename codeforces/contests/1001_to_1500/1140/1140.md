## G. Double Tree
In a normal tree, binary jumping can be used to find the distance between any node and its ancestor. So combine that with LCA to get the distance between any two nodes. This can be adapted to the double tree to find the minimum distance between any two nodes, as long as we know the following information: the shortest path from $2i$ to $2i-1$, for each $i\in[1,N]$.

The observation is that for any path from $2i$ to $2i-1$, the set of edges used in both trees are identical. So optimally, the path is from $2i$ to another node in the same tree, then cross over to the other tree via one of the $N$ edges connecting one tree to the other, then take the simple path in that tree to $2i-1$. We can therefore compress into one tree where the weight of the edge between two nodes $i$ and $j$ is the sum of the weights of the corresponding edges $(2i,2j)$; $(2i-1,2j-1)$ in the original two trees. Create an auxiliary node $0$ who is connected to each node $i$ by a directed edge of weight $w_{2i,2i-1}$ (i.e., the edges crossing between trees), and the shortest path between $2i$ and $2i-1$ is the shortest path between $0$ and $i$ in this new graph.

It runs in $O((N+Q)logN)$.
