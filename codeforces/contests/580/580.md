## C. Kefa and Park
There is only one path from the root to every node and leaf. Therefore, run DFS from the root and keep track of the number of consecutive vertices with cats at every node. If this node also contains a cat, increment that number by one. Otherwise, reset it back to zero. If at any point the current number of consecutives vertices exceeds $M$, then don't DFS further because this node, and thus its subtree, are unreachable. Also, the root doesn't count as a leaf in this problem, so make sure to keep track of that when testing if a node is a leaf (size of adjacency list is $1$).
