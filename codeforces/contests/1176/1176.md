## E. Cover it!
Take an arbitrary spannning tree of the graph. It's clear that coloring all nodes at odd depths will produce a valid coloring, but it may be that there are more than $\lfloor{N\over{2}}\rfloor$ vertices colored. But, coloring all nodes at an even depth will also work, and it must be the case that at least one of the odd coloring or even coloring colors $\le\lfloor{N\over{2}}\rfloor$ nodes. So we can try both, and take the one that works. It runs in $O(N)$.
