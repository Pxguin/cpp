## D. Wizard's Tour
We're asked to find the maximum amount of pairs (of two adjacent edges) that can be created. Direct each edge in the pair towards the middle (common) node and the problem is reduced to CSES - Even Outdegree Edges. Now we have each directed edge; if two directed edges point to the same node, then they are in the same episode so we can greedily pair edges up to create the maximum amount of episodes. $O(N+m)$ runtime.
