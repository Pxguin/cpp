# Educational CF Round 51

## F. The Shortest Statement
Find a spanning tree of the graph, as to discard $M-N+1$ edges. The idea is that it's easy to answer queries for a tree, and to generalize back to a normal graph, there are only $M-N+1$ possible edges we need to add in.

For each query, either we only use the edges on the tree (so use LCA), or we use some of the extra edges. Let the set of all endpoints of those edges be $S$. In that case, the path must pass through one or more vertices in $S$, so we can have precalculated Dijkstra from all nodes in $S$ and try putting each of them in the shortest path. The time complexity is $O(NlogN+(M-N)MlogN+Q)$.

I originally wanted to compress the spanning tree to only include all nodes in $S$ (so a path between $a$ and $b$, $a,b\in{S}$ in the tree becomes an edge between $a$ and $b$ now), add these new edges into a graph with the $N-M+1$ not in the spanning tree, and then run an $O(|S|^2)$ dijkstra (on the resulting graph) from $u$ to $v$ for each query, but that times out by a factor of $S$ although I think it's cooler.
