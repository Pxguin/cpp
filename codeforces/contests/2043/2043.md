# Educational Codeforces Round 173

## F. Nim
Because there's only $51$ possible $a$ values, each query can be independently solved. This is because for each $a$ value, we only care about the parity of the amount of occurences: if we add it an even number of times, then it contributes $0$ to the xor sum, and otherwise it contributes $a$.

Let $dp[i][j][k=0/1]$ be a pair that stores 1) the maximum amount of elements able to be removed, and 2) the amount of ways to remove those elements, if we have calculated up to $a<i$ and the elements we pick have an xor sum of $j$. $k$ is a marker that stores whether we have picked all elements so far ($1$ for yes, $0$ for no), because we must leave at least one pile remaining. The end goal is to return $dp[52][a_l\oplus{a_{l+1}}\oplus\dots\oplus{a_r}][0]$.

The dp is a knapsack: let the amount of occurences of $i$ in the range $[l,r]$ be $f_i$. If $f_i$ is odd, then
 - We can choose to add all occurences and change the xor sum by $i$.
 - We add all but two occurences, which changes the xor sum as well. The purpose is to make sure that we leave at least one pile remaining.
 - We add all but one occurence and don't change the xor sum.

Similar cases go for when $f_i$ is even. Generally, we try adding all occurences, all but one occurence, and all but two occurences.

Time complexity is $O(N+Qa^2)$. 

The time limit is still pretty tight (I got TLE three times) so a couple optimizations have to be made:
 - Use memset and arrays to initialize the dp (my first time doing it lol).
 - Only do a dp transition when it's possible. That is to say, only try removing one occurence when $f_i\ge{1}$, and try removing two when $f_i\ge{2}$ and $k=1$.
 - For a slight optimization, I changed mod multiply and mod add functions to take in int parameters and cast one of them to long long (instead of taking in long long parameters in the beginning), which could speed it up. I also avoided using mod when possible.
