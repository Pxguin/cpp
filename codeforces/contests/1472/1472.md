## E. Correct Placement
For the first condition ($h_j<h_i$ and $w_j<w_i)$, sort all friends by increasing height. Store the minimum width for each prefix of the sorted array. Then friend $i$ can be checked by finding the largest height such that it's less than $h_i$, and seeing if the minimum width at that position is $<w_i$.

If this method is used, checking the second condition comes naturally from the arrays we already constructed. Friend $i$ can be checked by finding the largest height such that it's less than $w_i$, and then checking if the minimum width is $<h_i$. So, the whole algorithm runs in $O(NlogN)$.
